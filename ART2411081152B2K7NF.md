Mr Kawee Meksongruek, Production Director of Thai Asia Pacific Brewery Co., Ltd., said: "Receiving these awards reflects our success in business operations under Heineken's sustainability strategy 'Brew a Better World', which emphasises the importance of social and environmental responsibility. We continue to enhance sustainability in concrete ways by collaborating with our employees and relevant public and private sectors to achieve sustainable goals in all aspects, including sustainable environmental development, community engagement within the brewery area for a better overall quality of life, and the organisation of various campaigns that promote social safety, including adherence to the principles of good governance in business. All of these align with the ESG concept, showing that TAP upholds sustainability across all dimensions."

**Green Industry - Level 4 Reflects TAP's Environmental Culture and Community Engagement** 

This year, TAP has advanced to become a green organisation by winning the Green Industry Level 4: Green Culture standard award. This accomplishment reflects the dedication of every employee within TAP to prioritise an environmental ethic as a fundamental part of the corporate culture, ensuring that all business activities are aligned with sustainable practices and ongoing collaboration with the communities surrounding the brewery area. Prior to achieving the Level 4 standard award, TAP had previously attained Green Industry certifications at Levels 1 through 3 in 2022. Each level symbolises progressive steps in TAP's journey towards sustainability:

*   Level 1 - Green Commitment: Demonstrates TAP's unwavering commitment through defined policies and strategic plans designed to mitigate environmental impacts
*   Level 2 - Green Activity: Represents the execution of targeted initiatives to actively reduce environmental impact
*   Level 3 - Green System: Highlights the establishment of a structured environmental management system, including regular performance assessments and continuous improvement

Achieving Level 4 standard award emphasises TAP's success in embedding environmental stewardship as a core corporate value. It also underscores the company's dedication to fostering positive and lasting relationships with nearby communities, contributing sustainably to the well-being of society and the environment.

**TAP Ranks Among 75 Leading Organisations in Energy Beyond Standards 2024 Conservation Network** 

TAP is one of Thailand's leading organisations participating in the energy conservation network of the Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency, Ministry of Energy, and has received the Energy Beyond Standards 2024 certificate, demonstrating its position as a model organisation for efficient energy usage. In addition to reducing energy consumption in all production processes, TAP has implemented the Brewed by the Sun project, a 1.2-megawatt solar farm covering 10 rai of land since 2022, to replace electrical energy used in the brewery with solar power. When the solar power system operates at full capacity, it will be able to generate electricity equivalent to 30% of the total electrical energy used in the brewery.

**"Zero Accident Campaign 2024" Promotes Workplace Safety**

Beyond environmental and community engagement initiatives, another crucial aspect is demonstrating effective management of safety, occupational health, and workplace environment. TAP brewery has participated in the Zero Accident Campaign, organised by Thailand Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (TOSH), aimed at preventing workplace accidents. The brewery received a Bronze Level Honorary Plaque for 2024, presented to business establishments that achieve zero accidents that lead to absence from work and have accumulated employee working hours between 1,000,000 - 2,999,999 hours.

Chef Yamamoto, renowned for his inventive take on Basque cuisine, will bring to Bangkok his signature dishes, which blend the rich flavours of traditional Basque cooking with the subtle and seasonal nuances of Japanese ingredients.

With a culinary career spanning two decades, chef Yamamoto honed his skills in traditional Japanese cuisine for six years before he went to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he mastered wood-fired cooking and South American cuisine. His further exploration took him to the Basque Country, where he trained at the Michelin-star restaurant Alameda, before opening Alarde in Osaka in 2016. 

Chef Yamamoto is known for his expertise with charcoal and wood-fired grills, presenting dishes that are both traditional and inspired by his cross-cultural experiences. At Uno Mas, he will showcase a specially curated menu highlighting the essence of Alarade’s cuisine, rooted in Basque traditions and enhanced by Japanese autumnal flavours.

The meal begins with a luxurious Foie gras bonbon, setting the stage for an array of four pintxos (small snacks), each offering a distinctive taste of Japan. These include Fresh shitake mushroom stuffed with Basque txistorra (or chistorra), Garum-marinated tuna and squid ink sauce, Sea urchin with Biscay sauce, Marinated sardines with Cantabrian anchovy-infused cream cheese and Salted scallops with shiso pesto.

The standout dish is Creamy rice with squid and matsutake mushroom consommé, a signature creation he perfected in the Basque Country, served for the first time outside Japan. He serves the dish with a delicate broth of kombu and bonito, finishing it with matsutake mushrooms and sudachi lime.

Diners will also get to enjoy Turbot in green sauce, white asparagus and potato. This umami-rich dish, characteristic of the Basque region, is also popular in Japan. For the main course, Wood-grilled Kamimura gyu beef rib eye is slow-grilled over wood, and seasoned simply with salt to highlight the meat’s natural flavours. The meal concludes with classic Basque cheesecake for a sweet finale.

Diners can enjoy them as a six-course meal with optional wine pairing. It'll set you back four grey notes for food only but more if you would like wine. Book early to secure your spot, as seats are limited. Visit the restaurant’s website.

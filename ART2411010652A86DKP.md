Panipak’s Career Record
-----------------------

**Panipak Wongpattanakit** is Thailand’s shining star in the world of sports. Over her impressive career, she has claimed over 21 gold medals and become a world champion in women’s taekwondo. Her sights are set on winning the upcoming **Olympic Games Paris 2024**.

**Panipak's** first world title medal came in 2015 when she became a world champion at the World Taekwondo Championships. Just one year later in 2016, Panipak secured a bronze medal in the **Rio Summer Olympics**. 

However, the bronze medal wasn't enough for the world champion as her sights were set on gold. In an interview with Bangkok Post, Panipak said, "I had a really good chance in Rio but in a fraction of a second, I blew it. I was so disappointed."

Feeling defeated and discouraged, Panipak took a break from taekwondo and almost quit the sport altogether, she told her coach. "I did not want to keep going. But after two months, I really missed taekwondo and resumed training."  

Coming back stronger and more determined than ever, **Panipak** secured yet another World Championships bronze medal in 2017. This marked the beginning of her dominant period, and the following year, she secured her first Asian Games gold medal in the 49 kg category. 

In the 2019 World Championships, **Panipak** clinched a gold medal in the flyweight event. Her exceptional skills and relentless drive were further acknowledged when she was awarded Female Athlete of the Year by World Taekwondo during the 2019 World Taekwondo Gala Awards.

Securing Thailand’s First Taekwondo Gold Medal  
------------------------------------------------

During the T**okyo 2020 Summer Olympics**, **Panipak** delivered a performance that would forever be remembered in Thai sporting history, claiming the nation's first **Olympic** gold medal in taekwondo. This was a moment of personal victory for Panipak and a moment of national pride. Thailand currently has a combined 35 **Olympic** medals, including 10 gold medals, the most in Southeast Asia.    

After securing a silver medal at the 2023 World Championships, she continued her success by claiming her 10th Grand Prix gold medal in the 49 kg category in June 2023. This achievement further cements her as a dominant force in taekwondo on the global stage. With her sights set on Paris, **Panipak** is seeking yet another gold medal at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games, which will be held from July 26th to August 11th.

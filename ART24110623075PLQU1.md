Phuket: Local authorities in Patong municipality are working to overhaul the city's motorcycle taxi service following a recent altercation among drivers over passengers.

People's Party MP for Phuket, Chalermpong Saengdee, said on Wednesday that a meeting was held to streamline regulations and bring order to motorcycle taxi stands in the tourist area of Patong.

The meeting, attended by local officials and authorities, aimed to address disputes and competition among motorcycle taxi drivers that have harmed the image of local tourism.

A representative from the Phuket Provincial Transport Office discussed guidelines for regulating public transport vehicles, noting that a supervisory committee will be created to address issues, including designating passenger pickup points.

The office says all motorcycle taxi drivers must be registered and hold a public transport driver's licence issued through a training programme. This aims to prevent altercations and ensure tourists are not exploited.

Kathu district chief Teerapong Chuaychu voiced concerns over the increasing incidents of public transport drivers engaging in fights over customers, which can put off tourists.

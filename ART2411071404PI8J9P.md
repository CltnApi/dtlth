KUNMING, China - Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Thursday proposed a 3Cs — connectivity, competitiveness and community — approach to build a stronger and more prosperous Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).

The summit’s theme, “Toward a Better Community Through Innovation-driven Development”, was timely and inspiring, she said in a statement after the plenary session of the event in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province in China.

“By harnessing innovation and technology, we can unlock new opportunities for growth and common prosperity while improving the lives of people across the GMS,” she said.

The 3Cs refers to enhancing connectivity, competitiveness and community for the benefit of those living in the region, according to the statement.

Connectivity remains a cornerstone of regional integration, it said. Thailand has made significant progress in connecting the subregion and beyond with the launch of the Bangkok-Vientiane international train service, the third phase development of Laem Chabang Port, as well as the plan to construct Lanna and Andaman airports, the statement said.

The second C stands for competitiveness. As the summit highlights innovation-driven development, Thailand will continue its commitment to drive digital transformation of its economy and society, it added.

Thailand is moving towards a cashless society by utilising the national digital payment platforms, namely PromptPay and cross-border QR code payment, it said.

The third C stands for community, which is the heart of the GMS, the statement said. There is a need to synergise collaboration across all sectors and expand social safety nets to cover all individuals, it said.

Thailand also supports the GMS Gender Strategy, which aligns with the country’s policy on inclusive development, it noted.

Ms Paetongtarn also encouraged her Mekong region colleagues to further promote equal access to quality education and safeguard social stability to ensure the well-being of people across the GMS, the statement said.

The eighth GMS Summit was also attended by the prime ministers of China, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam and the president of the Asian Development Bank.

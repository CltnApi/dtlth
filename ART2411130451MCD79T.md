ETIX Everywhere Expands Data Centre Presence in Thailand

ETIX Everywhere has announced a 1 billion baht investment aimed at solidifying its presence in Thailand’s data centre market. This investment will be allocated towards a share buyout of joint venture partner Interlink Telecom, as well as the construction of an additional data centre extension for ETIX Bangkok#1. This initiative highlights ETIX’s commitment to becoming a key player in Southeast Asia’s evolving data centre landscape. 

The investment follows ETIX Everywhere’s recent execution of a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Interlink Telecom, acquiring its 33% stake in ETIX Bangkok#1, formerly known as Genesis. The buyout is part of ETIX’s strategy to assume full ownership and to expand the centre’s IT capacity. Alongside the acquisition, ETIX Everywhere will build a new IT module with a 2 MW capacity, bringing the total capacity of ETIX Bangkok#1 to 4.7 MW. 

ETIX originally entered the Thai market in January 2022, acquiring a 67% stake in Genesis, a data centre with 600 kW of installed IT capacity. Less than three years later, ETIX is not only securing full ownership but also scaling the data centre’s capabilities to meet increased demand, predominantly from international clients. This expansion reflects a broader trend of rising data centre demand in Thailand, driven by the influx of global cloud providers and AI technology requirements. 

“Partnering with Interlink Telecom over the past three years has been a highly successful experience, and we have greatly appreciated their collaboration,” stated Louis Blanchot, Group CEO of ETIX Everywhere. “Today’s investment marks a new milestone for ETIX in Thailand, reinforcing our dedication to establishing ourselves as a major data centre provider in Bangkok.” 

Earlier this year, ETIX increased ETIX Bangkok#1’s capacity with an additional module, which was projected to fill within three years but sold out in just three months. This rapid uptake demonstrates the Thai data centre market’s swift evolution and growing demand for high-capacity investment, as noted by ETIX. Although Thailand’s data centre market trails behind those of Malaysia and Indonesia in dynamism, recent expansions by leading cloud providers are spurring significant supply and demand growth. Stable power infrastructure and robust data centre providers further position Thailand as an appealing market for international players in the AI and cloud computing sectors. 

“Our latest clients primarily consist of large international cloud, content, and AI providers,” remarked Pierre Patris, CEO Asia of ETIX Everywhere. “These clients are requesting substantial colocation capacity, and this additional module will cater to their immediate needs. However, this capacity alone won’t suffice, so we’ve secured additional real estate options to ensure we can meet ongoing demand. This move strengthens ETIX’s position as a scalable, AI-ready data centre operator in Southeast Asia.” 

While Thailand’s data centre industry remains in the early stages of the S-curve, it is poised for significant expansion. ETIX is strategically preparing for this projected growth through increased capacity and enhanced operational standards. Recent certifications at ETIX Bangkok#1, including ISO 14001, ISO 22301, ISO 27001, ISO 50001, and PCI DSS, reinforce the company’s commitment to maintaining high service quality as it scales. 

With this investment, ETIX Everywhere is positioning itself to cater to Thailand’s burgeoning data centre market and to support the infrastructure needs of global technology providers.

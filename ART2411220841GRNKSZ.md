There seems to be a recurring curse when it comes to adapting James Patterson's best-selling Alex Cross novels for the screen. Those who grew up in the 90s may remember crime thrillers Kiss The Girls (1997) and Along Came A Spider (2001), starring Morgan Freeman as the titular forensic psychologist and detective. Despite box office successes, these films received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics. The 2012 reboot, Alex Cross, starring Tyler Perry, fared even worse. Panned by critics and ultimately a box office bomb, it led to the cancellation of a planned sequel.

Now, Prime Video has taken a fresh stab at the franchise with Cross, an eight-episode series that aims to breathe new life into Alex Cross's story. Starring Aldis Hodge as the brilliant but troubled detective, the series chronicles his pursuit of some of America's most dangerous killers. While Cross begins on shaky ground, it eventually finds its footing, proving to be a mixed yet fair engaging effort.

The series introduces us to Alex Cross at a difficult juncture in his life. Haunted by the tragic death of his wife, Maria (Chaunteé Schuler Irving), and struggling to balance his career with his responsibilities as a father, Cross's personal and professional worlds are in turmoil. Teaming up with his loyal yet hot-headed best friend, John Sampson (Isaiah Mustafa), he embarks on a mission to capture a sadistic serial killer. Along the way, buried secrets from his past resurface, threatening to unravel the life he's painstakingly rebuilt.

Hodge is the heart and soul of the series, delivering a standout performance that elevates the material. His portrayal of Alex Cross captures the character's emotional complexity -- confident and methodical in his work, yet deeply vulnerable beneath his hardened exterior. Hodge's nuanced approach makes Cross a compelling figure, even when the narrative surrounding him falters.

Unfortunately, much of the supporting cast is saddled with clichéd archetypes. John Sampson is the loyal sidekick with a short fuse. The show features an outspoken female detective, a quirky comic-relief character, and a crooked superior seemingly out for personal gain. While the actors do their best, these roles feel underdeveloped and overly familiar.

The story picks up a year after Maria's death, and the stakes are personal from the outset. When a menacing figure begins taunting Alex at his home, his grief and anger are brought to the forefront. Meanwhile, the central mystery -- a chilling serial killer case -- unfolds across the eight episodes. However, the series struggles with pacing, particularly in its early episodes. The first half (episodes one through four) feel scattered, with too many plots competing for attention. I found myself losing hope during this stretch, but a pivotal moment in episode four reeled me back in, reigniting my interest and carrying me through to the finale.

While I haven't read the books, I can confidently say that the show's greatest strength lies in Hodge's performance. He breathes life into Alex, giving the character a depth that anchors the series. However, the antagonist is a significant weak point. They're a one-dimensional sociopath with a grandiose, cartoonish personality and no meaningful motivation beyond a desire for infamy. While a black-and-white portrayal of evil can work in certain contexts, this series, with its cat-and-mouse thriller structure, had ample opportunity to explore shades of gray. Unfortunately, it misses the chance to delve into the psychological parallels between Alex and his adversary, opting instead for a more simplistic approach.

With episodes ranging from 45 minutes to an hour, there was plenty of room for meaningful storytelling, but the writing doesn't fully capitalise on this potential. Some episodes hint at the show finding its rhythm, only to revert to uneven pacing and underwhelming resolutions. A tighter narrative with a clearer focus on one central storyline could have significantly elevated the series.

On a brighter note, Cross boasts strong production. Its modern aesthetic, engaging tone, and dynamic soundtrack inject a sense of freshness into the adaptation. The visuals and music work well to create a distinctive atmosphere, and there are moments that genuinely resonate emotionally. However, these high points are sporadic, leaving the overall experience feeling inconsistent.

So, who is Cross for? If you're a longtime fan of the novels and eager to see another live-action take on the character, this series might scratch that itch. For newcomers, it's an easy watch -- something you can enjoy without requiring intense focus. However, if you're looking for a deeply cerebral, edge-of-your-seat detective drama, Cross may not be the right fit. It's more of a popcorn crime thriller than a gripping masterpiece.

In the end, Cross is unfortunately another mixed bag added to the franchise -- one that shows glimmers of potential but doesn't quite stick the landing. While Hodge's impressive performance is reason enough to give it a shot, the show ultimately falls short of transcending the "curse" of its predecessors.

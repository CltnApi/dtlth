ALive Powered by AIA, the one-stop health and wellness application, has launched the “Be the Best Version of Yourself with ALive” campaign. This initiative aims to inspire individuals at every stage of life, bringing smiles and joy through activities that empower them to become better versions of themselves each day.

Running from October to December 2024, the "Be the Best Version of Yourself with ALive" campaign seeks to motivate individuals through a comprehensive, multi-channel approach across both online and offline platforms. Drawing on real-life insights into content consumption habits, the campaign specifically targets young professionals navigating busy working lives.

As part of the "Be the Best Version of Yourself with ALive" campaign, ALive has launched a series of advertisements under the same title, aiming to engage its target audience throughout their daily journey. Featuring well-known actor Pongsathorn ‘Phuak’ Jongwilas as the presenter, the campaign addresses key challenges faced by urban residents in three essential areas: physical health, mental well-being, and financial stability. ALive offers a comprehensive suite of resources to tackle health and financial concerns, encouraging everyone to prioritise self-care. The app's content blends knowledge, entertainment, and stress relief, empowering users to become their best selves. This ad series underscores ALive's mission to be the ultimate life supporter for all.

Mr Chutapatr Laothamatas, Director of Digital Solutions and Design at AIA Wellness, shared the inspiration behind the campaign: “The ‘Be the Best Version of Yourself with ALive’ campaign reinforces ALive’s commitment to supporting individuals in achieving their best selves in a holistic way, helping them to reach their health and well-being goals. This is particularly relevant for young professionals navigating busy urban lives. Insights show that they’re driven by success, prioritise self-improvement, and strive to enhance both physical and mental well-being for long-term quality of life. This campaign aligns with ALive’s goal to inspire and promote self-development, empowering users across multiple aspects of life. Moreover, it highlights how self-transformation can be more achievable than it may seem.”

“We anticipate that this campaign will increase awareness of the app, positioning ALive as a personal assistant guiding users towards becoming better versions of themselves. This initiative is in line with AIA’s mission to empower individuals for better health and well-being, fulfilling our promise of Healthier, Longer, Better Lives,” Mr Laothamatas added.

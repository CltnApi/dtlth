### Sleeping Sheep – An Underground Rock Band  

Aeg described his childhood as unruly. In an interview with BananaMaxTV, Aeg revealed that as a child, he often misbehaved and frequently moved in and out of schools.

Despite his early setbacks, Aeg's persistence eventually paid off when he was accepted into university. A lover of art, Aeg gradually gravitated towards music and singing during his university years. It was at university that he joined a band, discovered his passion, and decided to pursue music as his calling.

Sleeping Sheep is a popular Thai underground rock band formed in the early 2000s. In the same interview, Aeg explained that the band was already established by his seniors at university, and he did not start it. Aeg auditioned for the role of lead singer after the original vocalist left the band. Although his initial audition was met with some hesitation from the band members, it wasn’t until they saw him perform a cover at an underground rock gig that they decided to make Aeg the frontman. To date, the band has released three albums.

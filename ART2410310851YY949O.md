**Billkin’s** entertainment career began in 2016 with his first role as one of the main hosts in the Thai reality TV show _**Love Missions**_. The show served as a launching pad for his entertainment career. In an interview with _The Standard POP_, **Billkin** mentioned that he pursued a career in entertainment purely because he enjoys and loves it.

His breakthrough role came in 2019 as Doctor Tao, a supporting character in the drama series _**My Ambulance**_, starring **Davika Hoorne** and **Sunny Suwanmethanont**. This catapulted him into popularity, leading to his first lead role in _**I Told Sunset About You**_, where he starred alongside **Krit Amnuaydechkorn**, known as **PP Krit**. The film explores the relationship of two teenage boys as they come to terms with their identity, sexuality, and love.

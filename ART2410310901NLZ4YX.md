Asiatique Ancient Tea House, a beautifully restored, 111-year-old riverside dining destination, invites guests to experience “All-You-Can-Eat Yum Cha.” This offering is the ideal afternoon or evening treat for couples, families, and friends alike. 

Rooted in the southern Chinese tradition of yum cha, which has brought people together for generations, the experience celebrates a variety of small, flavourful dishes to share. At Asiatique Ancient Tea House, culinary experts uphold this tradition with a sublime selection of over 30 handcrafted dim sum dishes, rice rolls, noodles, stir-fried delights, desserts, and more. 

Highlights include signature prawn Har Gao with asparagus, crispy pastry with shrimp and prosciutto ham, foie gras, steamed crispy prawn rice roll, deep-fried purple sweet potato with shrimp and pork, and beef brisket egg noodle in chicken broth. Guests can complete their dining experience with a range of traditional desserts for a sweet finish. 

Conveniently located at Asiatique The Riverfront, the venue is accessible by road and river, with complimentary shuttle boat services from the pier next to Saphan Taksin BTS Skytrain station. 

The All-You-Can-Eat Yum Cha is available daily until 30 December 2024, from 12:00 – 24:00 hrs Monday to Friday, and 12:00 – 17:00 hrs on weekends. This special offer is priced at THB 888++ per person, including free-flow water and unlimited orders within a 1 hour and 30-minute session.

Phuket has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent years. Fringed by the Andaman Sea, this tropical oasis has evolved from a popular beach resort destination into one of the world’s most sought-after luxury residential markets, attracting elite consumer brands, Michelin-star dining, and international-standard education and medical care.

This evolution was highlighted in The Phuket Luxury Report, produced by C9 Hotelworks, the award-winning Phuket-based tourism, hospitality, and real estate consultancy. The report was unveiled at the “LivePhuket: A Global Luxury Lifestyle Destination” event held with Property Guru International (Thailand).

During the 90-minute event, Bill Barnett, Managing Director of C9 Hotelworks, presented key findings from The Phuket Luxury Report, revealing how competitive pricing, infrastructure enhancements, and lifestyle preferences are driving soaring demand for luxury living on the island.

“The island is the birthplace of two global luxury hospitality brands – Aman Resorts and Banyan Group. Key drivers of the luxury lifestyle sector here include a private jet terminal, five award-winning ultra-luxury hotels with average room rates exceeding USD 1,000 per night, four international-standard marinas hosting superyachts, 13 international schools, and a growing number of top-tier hospitals,” stated Bill Barnett, Managing Director of C9 Hotelworks.

Key highlights include developments led by the pioneering Banyan Group, the creator of Laguna Phuket, a 1,000-acre integrated destination community that now attracts 1 million visitors annually. This vibrant hub encompasses eight world-class hotels and resorts, an award-winning golf course, a BDMS wellness clinic, an international pre-school kindergarten, and 3,000 private homes. Additionally, Gardens of Eden, a green-inspired luxury wellness space in Bangtao, has sparked intense interest from a new generation of investors, with the sector valued at over USD 10 billion (THB 337 billion), according to the report.

A panel of top experts examined the factors influencing the rise of Phuket’s luxury sector in a series of moderated discussions. Topics included Insights from Phuket’s Luxury Developers, featuring Stuart Reading, Deputy CEO of Laguna Resorts (part of Banyan Group), and Ravi Chandran, Corporate Affairs Director at Gardens of Eden. The Luxury Brands segment was represented by Wilaiporn Pitimanaaree, Senior Vice President of Central Pattana; Praiya Laparojkit, Executive Director of Mercedes-Benz Phuket; Thiti Samuthrat, Assistant Hospital Director of Bangkok Hospital Phuket; and Roman Gorin, Managing Director of Gardens of Eden. Adding a culinary perspective, Marco Turatti, Executive Chef of InterContinental Phuket Resort, and Parkorn “Tan” Kosiyabong, Chef & Owner of GOAT Bangkok and LAAD Phuket, shared insights on Michelin-rated dining trends in Phuket, moderated by Sumi Soorian, Senior Advisor at Phuket Hotels Association.

Bill Barnett, Managing Director of C9 Hotelworks, commented: “In the post-pandemic era, Phuket’s real estate market has experienced exponential growth in the multi-million-dollar luxury residential sector. This trend is driven by changing lifestyles, with a growing emphasis on space, international services, and a rich, diverse way of life. Live Phuket is at the forefront of evolving values among global citizens.”

Ravi Chandran, Corporate Affairs Director at Gardens of Eden, remarked: “Phuket is one of the world’s most dynamic luxury markets, drawing a new generation of lifestyle-conscious families and individuals seeking tailored investments. At Gardens of Eden, we are creating a lifestyle-focused precinct with parks, lakes, and wellness activities covering over 70% of our space, just steps from Bangtao Beach.”

Stuart Reading, Deputy CEO of Laguna Resorts, a Banyan Group company, commented: “Ranked fourth globally in the branded residences sector, Banyan Group has played a pivotal role in pioneering tourism and branded residences in Phuket. From the launch of the world’s first Banyan Tree resort here in the 1990s to today’s real estate boom, including our new ultra-luxury Banyan Tree Residences, Phuket has become an extraordinary success story, and we are proud to have contributed to its growth.”

Wilaiporn Pitimanaaree, Senior Vice President of Central Pattana, said: “We have seen a substantial increase in demand for premium brands and recently launched a dedicated luxury floor at Central Phuket Floresta, showcasing top labels including Prada, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Rolex, and more. This strong demand underscores Phuket’s upscale transformation, now evident across the island.”

The statement said that the **Royal Thai Police** and **Immigration Bureau** are taking special measures to address issues related to the extension of stay by the **Immigration Act** (B.E.2522) and will take action against those who overstay in **Thailand** if they do not comply with the regulations.

Overstayers (any person holding a valid ID card) will be fined 500 baht per day, not exceeding 20,000 baht in total, without exception, at the Immigration Bureau.

Similarly, overstayers will be banned from re-entering Thailand based on the duration of overstay. The embassy announced that those who overstay for 90 days or more will be banned from re-entering Thailand for one year, those who overstay for one year or more will be banned from re-entering Thailand for three years, those who overstay for three years or more will be banned from re-entering Thailand for five years, and those who overstay for five years or more will be banned from re-entering Thailand for 10 years.

Therefore, the Myanmar Embassy in Thailand has issued a statement urging **Myanmar** citizens in Thailand for various reasons to carefully follow the rules and regulations set by the Thai Immigration Bureau to avoid overstaying, paying fines, and being denied entry to Thailand.

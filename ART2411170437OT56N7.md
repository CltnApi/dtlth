MANILA - Super typhoon Man-Yi swept across the Philippines' main island of Luzon on Sunday, threatening heavy rain in the capital region Metro Manila, after triggering more than a million evacuations and damaging buildings in several areas.

Packing winds of 185 kph (115 mph), it weakened slightly after hitting land in the town of Panganiban in Catanduanes province on Saturday night to arrive over the coastal waters of Camarines Norte province by 8am, weather officials said.

"We evacuated because every time there is a typhoon, the water rises in the nearby river," said Amalia Santisas, one those living near coastal areas in Manila, the capital, who followed evacuation orders.

"We have children with us and we are scared," added Santisas, who was among more than a million evacuated from the typhoon's expected path to keep them safe from storm surges.

Despite the evacuations, no casualties were reported, though the typhoon's strong winds damaged homes, schools and commercial buildings in Catanduanes, civil defence chief Ariel Nepomuceno told Reuters.

The sixth tropical cyclone to hit the Philippines in a month, Man-Yi is hurtling towards the southern and central areas of Luzon.

"Pepito is forecast to slightly weaken as a typhoon prior to its second landfall," state weather agency PAGASA said in a statement, using the storm's domestic name, as it urged precautionary measures.

"Significant weakening will occur during the passage of this tropical cyclone over mainland Luzon today."

The highest storm alert has also been declared for eastern parts of the islands of Polillo and Calaguas.

Winds had weakened in the Catanduanes town of Virac, and the rain had eased to a drizzle, allowing some of those who had sought shelter to return home, provincial disaster officer Roberto Monterola told DZBB radio.

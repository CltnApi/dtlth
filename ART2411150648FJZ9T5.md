Bayer Thai Co., Ltd. has received the AMCHAM Corporate Social Impact Award for the year 2024, marking the 6th consecutive year (Gold Level Award) from the American Chamber of Commerce in Thailand (AMCHAM Thailand). The award ceremony took place recently at the Avani Plus Riverside Hotel in Bangkok, reaffirming the company's commitment to conducting business responsibly towards society for sustainable development.

Mr. Bradley Williams (centre), Managing Director of Bayer Thai Co., Ltd., received the award from Mr. Robert Godec (left), U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, Mr. Simon Denye (right), AMCHAM Board of Governor and Corporate Social Impact Committee.

The American Chamber of Commerce in Thailand (AMCHAM) recognised the significant contributions of 114 member companies to Thai society and environment by honouring them at the 2024 AMCHAM Corporate Social Impact Awards.

For Bayer Thai, the company is dedicated to ongoing corporate social responsibility activities, collaborating with government partners and civil society to drive positive change and development in Thailand. Our CSR initiatives are guided by our mission: “Health for all, Hunger for none.”

One of the key initiatives is the "Young Love" project, which Bayer Thai has organised in collaboration with the Bureau of Reproductive Health, Department of Health, Ministry of Public Health, since 2014. This project focuses on providing appropriate contraceptive education to teenagers and working-age individuals to help reduce unwanted pregnancies among university students and factory workers. Participation in this initiative has increased every year, and this year, there are plans to hold a total of five events, expecting over 3,000 participants. Additionally, we conducted six workshops on family planning technology and women's health care for healthcare personnel this year, with over 700 participants.

♐ Sagittarius
-------------

**Nov 22 – Dec 21**

(⏰) An opportunity to show how good you are as a coordinator is on the cards. You achieve optimal productivity and accomplish great things. New opportunities come your way from within your office and outside. The unemployed will soon start their new job. Congrats! 

(₿) Financial negotiations are likely to be fruitful for all involved. Lifestyle inflation and instant gratification cause you to buy an experience or a thing that you have had an eye on for a long time. Be on high alert for investment scams promising unrealistic returns.

(♥) This weekend, couples enjoy cosy movie nights or low-key activities. It isn't about spending money; it's about spending time together. Unmarried couples may discuss their plans to live together.

(⚤) A romantic spark with someone you met through work or otherwise is possible. They seem keen to get to know you and lock you down. They may be moving too fast for you.

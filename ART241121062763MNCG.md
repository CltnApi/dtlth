Tour Finals out of reach for Ratchanok

![Ratchanok Intanon's season is over after her loss in the China Masters.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d03eb5a-6ffc-4f8f-98e5-056f12f53ded)

Ratchanok Intanon's season is over after her loss in the China Masters.

Thailand women's singles star Ratchanok Intanon has said her first-round defeat at the hands of South Korea's An Se-Young at the China Masters has ended her chances of making it to the season-ending BWF World Tour Finals.

Ratchanok put up a great fight before bowing out in a 24-22, 15-21, 21-19 epic on Tuesday in the Super 750 tournament in Shenzhen.

In a social media post in the wake of her early exit, Ratchanok said: "My chances of playing at the World Tour Finals this year ended beautifully enough for me.

"I am glad that everything was very good, just a small detail that needs improvement to make it perfect.

"My opponent @a\_sy\_2225 \[An\] as everyone knows, is always strong, whether on or off the court. She is a real fighter.

"I wish you \[An\] good luck and please come back with good feelings to play badminton with me next time like today.

"Thanks to my super team who always pushed me harder every single day, and also to the fans who are always cheering me no matter the outcome.

"See you guys again next year, for now it's relaxing time for me."

As for the other Thai players in the women's singles, Busanan Ongbamrungphan also exited the Shenzhen tournament in the first round, but Supanida Katethong and Pornpawee Chochuwong tasted success.

Pornpawee was in a dominating mood as she routed Gregoria Tunjung of Indonesia 21-13, 21-14 Wednesday and Supanida made short work of Germany's Yvonne Li, winning 21-14, 21-12.

Busanan lost 21-17, 21-19 to Indian ace Pusarla V Sindhu.

Thai mixed doubles pair of Dechapol Puavaranukroh and Supissara Praewsampran suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Hong Kong's Tang Chun-man and Ste Ying Suet, losing the opener 21-13, 17-21, 21-17.

In a major upset Wednesday, Mia Blichfeldt of Denmark ended Japanese star Akane Yamaguchi's Finals hopes.

The Danish player rallied to pull off a 14-21, 21-17, 21-17 victory over the seasoned Yamaguchi.

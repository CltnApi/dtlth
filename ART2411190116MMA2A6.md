The ‘**Bangkok Joint Initiative on Self-Care Medical Products for Health and Well-Being**’ was agreed upon at a **Joint Congress** hosted by the **Global Self-Care Federation** (**GSCF**), in collaboration with the **Asia-Pacific Self Medication Industry** (**APSMI**) and **Thai Self Medication Industry Association** (**TSMIA**), between November 13-15, 2024 in Bangkok.

**Self-CARER Member Organizations** and **APSMI Member Associations** from 9 countries/markets in the region (**Japan**, **Thailand**, **Chinese Taipei**, **Singapore**, **Korea**, **Indonesia**, **Vietnam**, **Malaysia**, and **Philippines**) participated in the Joint Initiative.

**Judy Stenmark** at The Global Self-Care Federation, said: “The Asia-Pacific region is facing significant demographic shifts, including a rapidly ageing population, a high prevalence of non-communicable diseases and a low number of doctors. With these problems set to worsen, there is a need for better self-care interventions to alleviate some of this burden. The new 'Bangkok Joint Initiative on Self-Care’ affirms our dedication to advancing self-care as an essential component of **Universal Health Coverage**.”

The theme of the Joint Congress in Bangkok is ‘Self-care in Healthcare: A Shared Vision of Asia Pacific’; its overall objective is to bring together industry, NGOs and regulators in the Asia-Pacific region to discuss and advance self-care.

The Congress builds on ongoing work to further the principles enshrined in the WHO Constitution and the **Sustainable Development Goals** (**SDGs**) that highlight the fundamental right to health and the need for participatory approaches to health governance, such as the **São Paulo Declaration on Self-Care**, which was adopted last year by Ministers of Health of the **Latin American** region.

**Sylvia Tsai** at the Asia-Pacific Self-Medication Industry, said: “This is an impressive multi-sectoral collaboration that promises to advance self-care and enhance policy and practice. By working together, we have the power to shape regulatory frameworks, eliminate barriers and create inclusive policies that empower individuals to leverage self-care to make better health and wellbeing decisions.”

  Signatories of the Joint Initiative have agreed to advance self-care by:

●    Promoting Self-Care medical products for improved health literacy

●    Leveraging Technology and Digital Solutions

●    Strengthening Collaboration and Public-Private Partnerships

●    Ensuring Equity and Inclusivity

●    Advocating for Better Self-Care Governance

Dr **Junko Sato**, **Co-Chair**, of **Self-CARER** (**PMDA**), said: “Through self-care, we can empower individuals to actively manage their health and prevent diseases, leading to improved outcomes and quality of life. It must not be overlooked as a key cornerstone to improving health outcomes. Instead, we must recognize its value and integrate self-care practices into health systems to better support health outcomes across the Asia-Pacific region.”

In addition to the Joint Initiative, three new studies in the region will also be launched at the congress, with APSMI publishing two first positions on e-labeling and digital health and the **EU-ABC** publishing a paper on the strategic role of self-care. These multistakeholder studies add to the increasing volume of research showing that when people take charge of their health through self-care, they prevent diseases and live better lives.

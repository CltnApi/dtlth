30 years of global learning

In an era when the world is all about cultural **diversity** and endless possibilities, growing up means not only a path toward academic achievement but also embracing a broader perspective of being a **global citizen**.

The International Schools Association of Thailand (Isat) was established in 1994 to promote high standards of educational quality, ethical practices and student learning among its members.

"Guided by the United Nationâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals, Isat promotes values such as sustainability, equality, and ethical leadership." -- Usa Somboon Isat president

Now, with 193 member schools, Isat is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year and it is taking pride in fostering the education of Thai and foreign students in international schools across Thailand, preparing them to be responsible, knowledgeable, and compassionate members of the global community.

Usa Somboon, Isat president, said the calibre of education of the Isat member schools is aligned with the highest international education standards and recognised by accreditation organisations while agreeing with Thailand's national education policies.

Ms Usa explained that the association's philosophy emphasises preparing students to become compassionate, responsible, and future-focused individuals.

She said Isat is committed to developing students who excel academically and are equipped to contribute to society positively.

"Guided by the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals, Isat promotes values such as sustainability, equality, and ethical leadership.

"These principles help students develop the skills and mindset needed to address contemporary global challenges and make a meaningful impact on the world," Ms Usa added.

Jim O'Malley, head of Ruamrudee International School, said international schools in Thailand recognise the importance of holistic development and increasingly focus on providing resources to help students achieve balance and resilience in their lives.

"Schools and teachers have a role in preparing students not just for academic success but also for meaningful contributions to global society," he said.

According to Felicity Ayre, head of Kids' Academy International School, many international schools have embraced the concept of global citizenship and sustainability, where students are taught to be respectful and globally minded in a multicultural environment.

She said that's made international schools a key leader in education reform.

As the world continuously faces climate change, technology, and geopolitics, school authorities have pointed out that academic knowledge alone might not be enough to cope with such ongoing disruptions.

Duncan Stonehouse, head of Bangkok International Preparatory & Secondary School (Bangkok Prep), said that schools should assist students in becoming positive, involved, and caring individuals socially and academically.

"Children should be globally minded, honest, responsible, resourceful, brave and respectful," he said.

Bruce Grindlay, principal of Rugby School Thailand, said that students need to be creative, collaborative and great communicators -- all the things that AI can not do.

He suggested the education system should equip students with greater interdisciplinary work focusing on hybrid jobs and skills, including marketing, business, basic coding and website design.

"They need to be the jockey to AI's racehorse, harnessing its power but controlling it from a human perspective," Mr Grindlay added.

Sascha Heckman, head of International School Bangkok, said that students need to be able to think across disciplines as global challenges are multidisciplinary problems.

"As the world keeps changing, students need to face lots of ambiguity. Therefore, they need to have emotional regulations to manage a variety of perspectives and define their opinion of their own.

"Therefore, the school needs to equip students with social and emotional competency such as self-regulation, self-management, and relationship skills," Ms Heckman said.

Lek Sachathep, director of Kids Kingdom Ruamrudee International Kindergarten, said that students need to have digital literacy and technical proficiency.

She said this will prepare them for the digital economy's demands and empower them to navigate emerging technologies effectively.

Furthermore, collaboration and adaptability are crucial for working with diverse teams and adjusting to the rapidly changing circumstances of the modern world.

Together, these skills will empower students to thrive in an unpredictable future.

"The education systems must equip students with a forward-thinking mindset that addresses current and emerging global challenges," she said.

The Isat president, Ms Usa, said that the association envisioned a future where education continues to inspire lifelong learners and compassionate innovators who could adapt to the various disruptions.

"To make such learners, teachers should be equipped with professional teaching skills while being updated with trends and changes, able to tailor teaching according to the student's ability, and most importantly, listen to their voices.

"Schools and homes need to work closely to ensure the performance and wellbeing of the students so they can grow and be adaptable to various challenges in the future," Ms Usa said.

November 26, 2024 — Bangkok Medical Software Co, Ltd (BMS), together with Looloo Health, uses  Microsoft technology to empower healthcare professionals in 35 hospitals across Thailand with "PresScribe," an innovative AI-powered solution. Integrated with BMS-HOSxP and BMS-HOSxP XE systems, PresScribe transcribes doctor-patient conversations and automatically summarizes key medical information. This frees up clinicians to focus on meaningful patient interaction and deliver more effective care. BMS plans to expand PresScribe's availability to hospitals nationwide.

PresScribe is revolutionizing medical documentation. Developed by Looloo Health, a medical AI company under Looloo Technology, this innovative solution leverages the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service. PresScribe offers a specialized speech-to-text tool precisely tailored for complex medical terminology, transforming how doctors document patient interactions. 

Currently, doctors face the time-consuming burden of manually documenting patient consultations. PresScribe automates this process, transcribing conversations and allowing immediate verification for accuracy. This ensures crucial details are captured, significantly improving efficiency and reducing administrative workload. Enhanced accuracy is particularly valuable in busy public healthcare settings with limited staff, promising improved patient care and a more effective use of overstretched public health resources. 

PresScribe It has been officially open for service since November 1, 2024, initially piloting in 35 hospitals nationwide that use BMS-HOSxP and BMS-HOSxP XE systems, with an upcoming plan for broader expansion across Thailand. Early projections indicate that PresScribe implementation could reduce physicians' documentation time by up to 80%, allowing healthcare providers to focus more on patient care.

By reducing the burden of manual notetaking, physicians can devote more attention to their patients during consultations. The system efficiently records and summarizes key information, ensuring critical details aren't missed. This allows for more meaningful conversations and deeper understanding, ultimately supporting more effective and higher-quality care."

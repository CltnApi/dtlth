The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has adjusted its target of welcoming visitors from China in 2025 from 8.8 million to 9 million people, as it eyes achieving at least 90% of the pre-Covid level, governor **Thapanee Kiatphaibool** said on Tuesday.

Chinese arrivals to Thailand reached a record high of 11 million people in 2019, before the pandemic hit.

Thapanee said achieving this 90% milestone would also celebrate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries next year.

As for this year, the TAT expected to welcome 7.3 million Chinese tourists, who would generate around 450 billion baht of revenue for Thai entrepreneurs.

Between January 1 and November 24, a total of 6.09 million Chinese visitors entered Thailand, making China the biggest market for foreign tourists out of the total foreign arrivals of 31.31 million people.

Thapanee said natural factors such as storms in China and flooding in Thailand have slowed down Chinese arrivals during September and October.

However, thanks to the Loy Krathong Festival which saw activities being held in several provinces of Thailand, more Chinese tourists started arriving in November in a trend that the TAT expected to maintain until January, she said.

In order to achieve the target next year, the TAT has discussed with Chinese airlines the possibility of increasing flight routes as well as frequency to Thailand from New Year until Songkran Festival in April, said Thapanee.

“Priority will be placed on flights from tier 2 and tier 3 Chinese cities to explore new markets and attract tourists with high purchasing power. We would, however, still maintain focus on the main markets of group tours and MICE travellers,” she said.

Earlier, Tourism and Sports Minister **Sorawong Thienthong** said he led a Thai delegation to attend the China International Travel Mart 2024 (CITM) event, held in Shanghai from November 22-24. The event is a platform for Thai tourism operators to negotiate with partners and present their products and services to Chinese travel agents.

Sorawong said that he met with **Zhang Zheng**, China’s vice minister of culture and tourism, and assured him that Thailand is a safe place to visit, refuting claims by fake news that have raised doubts among Chinese people planning to visit the kingdom.

The minister also asked Chinese authorities to help communicate measures that Thailand has put in place to ensure the safety of foreign visitors, including the use of AI technology.

The Provincial Waterworks Authority (PWA) has unveiled its 2025 policy and operational roadmap, "PWA First," aimed at driving organisational excellence across all facets of water utility services while aligning with national and Ministry of Interior directives. The announcement was made on November 4, 2025, at PWA Headquarters in the Prapawiwat Building.

PWA Governor Chakapong Kamchan shared that, upon assuming his role, he is committed to elevating the quality of life for citizens and meeting customer needs through the "PWA First" policy. This initiative prioritises both organisational advancement and service enhancement, focusing on five pillars: 

*   **F****:** Financial Stability — Securing appropriate financial resources and funding
*   **I****:** Instant Water Loss Control — Reducing water loss rates
*   **R****:** Resource Management — Maximising resource efficiency
*   **S****:** Sustainability — Building organisational strength for long-term resilience
*   **T****:** Technology and Innovation — Embracing modern technology to stay ahead 

Governor Chakapong outlined PWA’s Three-Phase Operational Strategy, spanning short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals: 

*   **Short-term (Fiscal Year 2025)****:** Maintain service standards, reduce water loss, and enhance customer satisfaction
*   **Mid-term (Fiscal Years 2026-2027)****:** Integrate digital technology, boost water production, manage costs, embrace clean energy, and cut carbon emissions
*   **Long-term (Fiscal Years 2028-2029)****:** Increase operational flexibility with diverse revenue strategies, including updates to the PWA Act (1979) and public-private partnerships (PPP) 

In 2025, PWA aims to expand its customer base by 235,000 households, increase water distribution by 50 million cubic metres, and limit water loss to below 26.30%. An investment budget of 11.6 billion baht will fund projects to expand water services, upgrade distribution efficiency, and install new pipelines in local administrative areas. Additionally, PWA has secured over 4.5 billion baht in government support for the Ministry of Interior's “Clean Drinking Water for the Public” initiative, aimed at reducing disparities and ensuring affordable access to safe drinking water. 

To further promote clean, affordable drinking water, PWA is launching three major initiatives: 

1.  **Clean Drinking Water Mini Stations****:** PWA will open 30 new stations in 2025
2.  **Drinking Tap Water Project****:** In collaboration with the Department of Health, PWA has certified 264 areas with safe drinking tap water, subject to regular inspections every three years
3.  **Free Drinking Water Dispensers****:** PWA will install dispensers at 234 branches nationwide 

The PWA Governor emphasised the organisation’s dedication to enhancing water services under the "PWA First" policy, advancing both the agency and public services in alignment with government and Ministry of Interior goals.

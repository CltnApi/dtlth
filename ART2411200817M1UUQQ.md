Bangchak Executive Highlights ASEAN Carbon Market Vision

Gloyta Nathalang, Senior Executive Vice President of Sustainability Management and Corporate Communications at Bangchak Corporation and Chairperson of the Carbon Markets Club, took the stage at COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, to lead discussions on advancing the ASEAN carbon market. Representing Bangchak at two pivotal side event panels, she emphasised the need for regional cooperation and technological innovation to drive sustainable development. 

On 18 November 2024, Gloyta signed a Memorandum of Collaboration (MoC) at the Malaysia Pavilion, supporting the ASEAN Common Carbon Framework (ACCF). The ACCF sets out to establish robust standards for efficient and transparent carbon credit trading, fostering a low-carbon economy across ASEAN. Following the signing, she joined a panel discussion alongside signatories from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and ASEAN associations, highlighting the collective benefits of harmonised standards, resource sharing, and enhanced market efficiency. 

In the second panel, "From Zero to Carbon Hero: Unlocking the Power of Tech-Powered Carbon Credits," Gloyta explored the transformative potential of technology in developing high-quality carbon credits. Drawing from Bangchak Group’s projects, she presented innovations such as BCPG’s blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer solar energy trading and the Plant D initiative, which uses satellite monitoring and digital data management to ensure compliance with T-VER standards while promoting clean energy and sustainable agriculture. 

These discussions underscored the critical role of collaboration and technology in standardising carbon markets across ASEAN, aligning with the Carbon Markets Club’s mission to mitigate the climate crisis through impactful carbon credit trading initiatives.

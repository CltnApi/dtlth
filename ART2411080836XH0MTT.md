GAC AION, a major Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, partnered with Thailand's Board of Investment (BOI) to identify local parts suppliers through business negotiations at the “AION Sourcing Day.” This initiative supports the upcoming EV production launch in 2025, positioning Thailand as a comprehensive EV production hub in ASEAN. A total of 74 companies participated, and the potential value of local parts procurement is projected to exceed 2.25 billion THB.

On November 6, 2024, Mr. Narit Therdsteerasukdi, Secretary-General of the BOI, and Mr. Ocean Ma, CEO of AION Automobile Manufacturing (Thailand) Co., Ltd., jointly organised the "GAC AION Sourcing Day" at Rama Gardens Hotel, Bangkok. The event aimed to source parts from local suppliers for GAC AION’s EV production line, set to begin early 2025. The company seeks suppliers in seven critical component groups: Interior Parts, Exterior Parts, E&E Parts, Chassis Parts, Car Body Parts, Traction Motor Parts, and Battery Parts, attracting over 74 suppliers to the event.

"This event underscores the collaboration between BOI and GAC AION to develop Thailand’s EV industry, especially by enhancing Thai automotive parts suppliers’ access to the EV supply chain. This includes local parts procurement, manufacturing subcontracting, technology transfer, and joint ventures with foreign companies, creating mutual benefits. GAC AION can connect with high-quality, experienced suppliers located near the company’s plant, improving production efficiency and reducing logistics costs. Meanwhile, Thai suppliers gain access to cutting-edge technology, business opportunities, and benefits from the investments of a top foreign company,” said Mr. Narit.

Campaign takes aim against discrimination in Thailand

Thai civil society organisations have begun a campaign promoting five recommendations to the government they say would help tackle the discrimination that is still prevalent against vulnerable groups.

Representatives from 80 civil groups recently attended the "Building Bridges, Breaking Barriers" event at the TK Palace Convention Centre in Bangkok.

They said the gathering was to show strength and unity as they called for the government to enact changes in the law to bring about a fairer society.

The event was held by the Foundation for Action on Inclusion Rights (FAIR), People's Movement to Eliminate Discrimination (MovED), and Thai Health Promotion Foundation (ThaiHealth).

The first of the five proposals is to improve knowledge and awareness of diversity. Regardless of identities and differences such as gender and ethnicity, the government and healthcare providers must be prepared to deal with sexual problems, prisoners' healthcare, safe abortion and mental illness, among other things.

Secondly, healthcare should be standardised, inclusive and accessible for all regardless of differences and requirements, they said.

At the same time, healthcare providers should inform people of the benefits and welfare they are entitled to under universal health coverage. This requires more interpreters employed in healthcare settings and compensation for those who are discriminated against or mistreated by medical professionals.

Thirdly, there should be a budget and more investment in innovation to create and promote equality.

The groups' fourth recommendation is for communities be invited to participate in the checks and balances on government initiatives. Lastly, laws and regulations related to discrimination should be revised.

The government must back a new Anti-Discrimination Bill and review the current regulations to ensure fair access to healthcare for all, say the groups.

**Pathum Thani**. It has long been said that the best way to experience a Porsche is behind the steering wheel; that is why the exhilarating Porsche World Roadshow (PWRS) is making a highly-anticipated return to Thailand after two years at the Pathum Thani Speedway. 

Porsche Thailand hosted the media on 15 November 2024 for this ultimate Porsche driving experience, providing an exclusive opportunity for them to experience the excitement ahead of the general public. From 16 to 25 November 2024, Porsche customers and fans in Thailand are invited to experience the latest line-up of models from the iconic German sports car brand. 

Led by certified Porsche instructors from Thailand and Europe, participants can look forward to a day of guided driving with exercises ranging from Handling, Braking & Moose Test evasive driving techniques, Slalom, and Road Tour – so that drivers of all skill levels come away with a valuable experience. Members of the public, above the age of 21 with a valid driving license, are welcome to participate in the event. 

26 Porsche sports cars will be lined up for drivers to experience, from track weapons like the 718 Cayman GT4 RS, to acceleration missiles like the 911 Turbo S Cabriolet from the first 992 generation. With a combined output of nearly 10,000 PS, the Porsche World Roadshow provides a once-in-a-lifetime chance to drive some of the most sought-after sports cars, creating unforgettable memories on the track in the process. One particular highlight on display: the 1,034 PS Taycan Turbo GT capable of delivering an additional 120 kW ‘Attack Mode’ at the push of a button.

"The Porsche World Roadshow is the ultimate platform for showcasing the maximum dynamic potential of our high-performance cars. We are thrilled to host PWRS once again in Thailand, as we continue to deliver compelling products and unforgettable experiences for our customers and fans in the Kingdom," said Mr. Winthorn Bunnag, Acting Managing Director of Porsche Thailand by AAS Group. 

"After many exciting milestones such as the introduction of the first regionally-assembled Cayenne S E-Hybrid and the preview of the all-electric Macan in Bangkok, we now take our thrills to the racetrack; here, it’s all about discovering the passion, innovation and performance of Porsche – best seen directly behind the wheel of our sports cars," Mr. Bunnag continued. 

**On track for the first time in SEA: the all-new 911** 

The new and comprehensively-updated Porsche 911 Carrera will feature on track in Southeast Asia for the very first time at PWRS Thailand. Unveiled just months ago, the new 911 perfectly blends performance and innovation, with sharpened looks, a new digital cockpit and a comprehensively-revised twin-turbo 3.0-litre boxer engine. 

The new streamlined exterior of the 911 Carrera features model-specific front aprons and integrated Matrix LED headlights with the characteristic four-point look, which now come as standard. The daytime running LEDs at the front now also function as turn signals, freeing up more space for larger cooling vents in the front of the car. At PWRS Thailand, the new 911 will be showcased in new colours such as Lugano Blue and Shade Green. 

Inside, the car is updated with new technology such as a push start button on the left of the steering wheel, a nod to GT racing cars in the modern era. For the first time, the 911 also comes with a fully-digital 12.6-inch instrument cluster. The curved display offers up to seven views, including an exclusive Classic display based on the traditional design with five round dials, including a central rev counter. 

With new engine innovations like turbochargers carried over from the previous generation’s GTS models and a charge-air cooler taken from the Turbo, the new 911 Carrera achieves a remarkable power output of 290 kW (394 PS) and a maximum torque of 450 Nm, and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 4.1 seconds (3.9 seconds with the Sport Chrono package).

**New Taycan and Macan make first track appearances at PWRS** 

PWRS Thailand participants can look forward to driving the latest Porsche E-Performance models – the comprehensively-updated Taycan and the new, all-electric Macan. Both these new models will be showcasing their dynamic abilities on track for the first time in Thailand at this event.  

After setting three track records on three continents – the Weathertech Raceway Laguna Seca in North America, the Nürburgring Nordschleife in Europe and the Shanghai International Circuit in Asia – the Taycan Turbo GT returns as a highlight display car at the upcoming PWRS Thailand.  

Thanks to lightweight construction measures, Porsche has reduced the weight of the Taycan Turbo GT by up to 75 kg compared to the Taycan Turbo S. The Taycan Turbo GT produces a spectacular 1,034 PS as standard, but can achieve short boosts of peak power via a 120 kW ‘Attack Mode’, meaning it is the most powerful series production Porsche available today.  

Porsche has given the Taycan a particularly extensive update, with more power, longer range, faster acceleration and quicker charging with greater stability. The iconic Germany sports car brand has also sharpened the design and more strongly differentiated the Turbo models.  

All Taycan versions feature an even more extensive standard equipment list and come with the latest generation of the Porsche Driver Experience: a fully digital display, versatile individualisation and intuitive operation.

Porsche’s first all-electric SUV, the new Macan, will also be available for customers and fans to experience at PWRS Thailand. The new Macan features timeless design, characteristic Porsche performance, long-distance range and high levels of everyday practicality, completely fulfilling the requirements of Porsche customers wanting an SUV.  

The numbers alone indicate top-class E-Performance: The Macan produces up to 265 kW (360 PS) of overboost power, while the top-of-the-line Macan Turbo boasts up to 470 kW (639 PS). The maximum torque across the range varies from 563 Nm to 1,130 Nm. The Macan accelerates from a standstill to 100 km/h in 5.7 seconds, while the Macan Turbo takes just 3.3 seconds.  

The familiar Macan silhouette is now enhanced by Porsche Active Aerodynamics (PAA) to create a remarkably low drag coefficient of 0.25 Cd, combining power with aerodynamic efficiency for maximum performance on track. Add to this an increased amount of interior space and practical features like a large boot and 84-litre ‘frunk’, and the Macan ready to set new benchmarks as the sportiest compact SUV for participants at PWRS Thailand. 

The Porsche World Roadshow runs from 16 to 25 November 2024 at Pathum Thani raceway. Tickets to the Porsche World Roadshow in Thailand start from THB 25,000 for a weekday slot (Monday to Friday) and THB 30,000 for a weekend slot (Saturday and Sunday), with the option to bring a guest. 

Each ticket covers driving programmes and meals throughout the day, ensuring both a thrilling and luxurious experience. Registration is currently available at all Porsche Centres and Studios across Thailand.

On April 19, 2023, Thongpin Kiatchanasiri, 63, filed a complaint at the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) after suspecting foul play in the death of her daughter Siriporn Chanwong, 32.

Siriporn, the leader of a rotating savings group in Kanchanaburi province, collapsed and died while participating in a merit-making event in Ratchaburi’s Ban Pong district on April 14, 2023. Her belongings, including over 40,000 baht in cash, were reported missing.

The complaint against Sararat Rangsiwuthaporn, 36, then-wife of former deputy chief of the Ban Pong Police Station, Pol Lt-Colonel Withoon Rangsiwuthaporn, raised concerns of possible interference in the investigation and tampering of evidence.  
   
**Arrest and discovery of cyanide**

On April 25, 2023, Crime Suppression Division officers arrested Sararat and seized cyanide from her house.

Forensic tests on Siriporn’s body showed that she had been poisoned with cyanide and investigators said they suspect Sararat poisoned her so she could steal her belongings. Siriporn was reportedly her 15th victim.

Further investigation revealed 14 additional victims linked to Sararat – 13 of whom had died, but one survived. The victims were linked to Sararat through loans, used car sales and rotating savings groups.  
Sararat allegedly meticulously planned these murders, committed over a span of eight years, poisoning her victims with potassium cyanide and making their deaths appear to be from heart failure or other health complications.

Investigators learned that the suspect chose to commit the murders during weekends and would later return to the family or close associates to provide fabricated evidence to divert suspicion.  
   
**Monumental investigation**

The investigation led by Pol General Surachate “Big Joke” Hakparn, then deputy police chief, became one of the largest in Thai history.  
The case file comprised 26,500 pages, involved 900 witnesses and three months of evidence gathering.

Sararat faces 75 charges, including attempted murder, premeditated murder, robbery resulting in death, adulterating food or drink resulting in death and forging documents.

Investigation revealed that the suspect was addicted to gambling and was overburdened with loans from both formal and informal sources. To pay off these debts, the suspect resorted to killings and her three main methods were:

Taking the victim out to a meal before poisoning them with cyanide, then bringing them home where they eventually died.

Picking up the victim from their home, poisoning them and leaving them behind to die.

Sending cyanide-spiked “diet pills” to victims’ homes, ultimately leading to their death.

**Court proceedings and verdict**

On July 19, 2023, charges were filed against Sararat for poisoning and robbing Siriporn. The suspect’s ex-husband Withoon, and her lawyer Thannicha Akesuwanwat were also charged with concealing evidence and helping her evade punishment. All three pleaded not guilty.

The Criminal Court set the trial dates from July 4 to September 12, 2024, and issued a verdict on Wednesday (November 20).  
In its verdict, the court sentenced Sararat, aka “Am Cyanide”, to death for poisoning and killing Siriporn. Withoon received a reduced prison sentence of one year and four months after he cooperated, while the lawyer was sentenced to two years in prison for aiding Sararat.

The case continues to unfold, with authorities investigating 14 more cases linked to the so-called “Cyanide Killer”.

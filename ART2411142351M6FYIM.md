Taipei: Thailand's Runchanapong Youprayong and Australian Jack Thompson took a share of the clubhouse lead on day one of the Taifong Open yesterday after astonishingly finishing their rounds with three birdies and an eagle for eight-under-par 64s.

Runchanapong, in just his second year as a professional, played in the morning session and had the outright lead for much of the day thanks to a storming finish with three birdies in a row from 15 before an eagle on the par-five 18th.

It looked like he would remain out in front on his own before Thompson, on a mission to finish before play was called for the day with darkness closing in, signed off in similarly spectacular fashion by making birdies on 15 and 16, before registering an eagle on 16, and a birdie on the last.

Thailand's Danthai Boonma fired a 65 while Canadian Jared Du Toit shot 66, at the par-72 Taifong Golf Club.

Heavy fog first thing in the morning meant the start was delayed by an hour and 20 minutes; the end result being 33 players will have to compete their first rounds this morning.

Runchanapong, who hit a six iron to 10 feet on 18 to set up his eagle, said: "I have been struggling with my putter. Ball striking has been OK, so it was good to see a few putts rolling in today."

He made it through the Asian Tour Qualifying School last year but was unable to keep his card and has been playing mainly on the Asian Development Tour, where he has shown some form recently with three top 10s.

He's also enjoying playing here this week thanks to the fact that the Tournament Director Krirkchai Boonprasert is his former coach.

"He was actually my first coach. He coached me from six until 14 before he moved into being a referee and I went to college in the US. It's really great to see him out here," said Runchanapong.

Both he and Thompson played the back nine in six-under-par 30, and the finish late in the day definitely left Thompson stunned.

"I can't remember the last time I played like that," said the Australian.

"To finish strong like that. Finishing birdie, birdie, eagle, birdie, that really helps. It was getting really dark, so I guess I played even better to try and finish."

He won last year's Asian Tour Qualifying School and enjoyed a strong first season, but he is currently 87th on the Asian Tour Order of Merit and in a battle to retain his playing privileges.

"I am not where I want to be in terms of keeping my card, but this is the kind of round I needed to have a chance," he added.

Thailand's Suteepat Prateeptienchai, the defending champion, is five under with three to play.

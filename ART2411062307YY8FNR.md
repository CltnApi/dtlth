The iCon Group, the direct sales company at the centre of an alleged public fraud scam, has refused to refund its dealers' cancelled trips, saying all its assets have been frozen.

The company posted an announcement on its Facebook page on Wednesday saying that "money in its bank accounts and other assets have been frozen pending an investigation and therefore it cannot provide refunds for cancelled trips for its dealers. Refund payments will have to be postponed until further notice".

The cancelled trips were arranged by the company as rewards for its dealers.

Meanwhile, police from the Anti-Corruption Division on Wednesday questioned detained Warathaphon "Boss Paul" Waratyaworrakul, the company's founder and CEO, over a lawsuit he filed against Kritanong Suwanwong, owner of the Facebook page "Kritanong Against Corruption".

Mr Warathaphon accused Ms Kritanong of extorting money from the iCon Group. She denied the claim, saying victims only asked her for help in seeking compensation.

Police also questioned Mr Warathaphon over another complaint he filed against Ekapob Luangprasert, founder of a popular Facebook page aiding crime victims.

The complaint came after Mr Ekapob said an unnamed witness claimed they had evidence that influential officials in some state agencies could help key suspects in the case get off the hook.

According to Mr Ekapob, the witness said the officials are in the Office of the Consumer Protection Board, Department of Special Investigation (DSI), Consumer Protection Police Division, and Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau.

Late last month, police began receiving complaints from a group of damaged parties that now numbers at least 10,000 people.

Their claims amount to losses of about three billion baht, which they incurred through their dealership of iCon Group products.

The DSI has accepted the case for investigation and is coordinating with the Office of the Attorney General to have financial and tax experts support the probe, especially in analysing complex financial trials and tax records.

Mr Warathaphon is being detained at Bangkok Remand Prison.

Bangchak Sriracha Public Company Limited (BSRC) has entered a landmark partnership with the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) and the Zoological Park Organization under the Royal Patronage of H.M. The King, aimed at protecting endangered wildlife through space and geoinformatics technology. The collaboration, formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), was signed at Thailand Space Week 2024 at IMPACT Muang Thong Thani on 7 November. 

Representatives from each organisation, including Mrs. Matana Sutatham, CFO of BSRC; Dr. Pakorn Apaphant, Executive Director of GISTDA; and Mr. Narongwit Chodchoi, Director of Khao Kheow Open Zoo, emphasised the joint commitment to conservation. Witnesses included Dr. Bowornsak Wanichkul, Government Relations & Sustainability Lead at BSRC, and Dr. Siriluk Prukpitikul, Deputy Executive Director of GISTDA. 

A flagship project of this alliance, Bio-Conservation: A Mission for Biodiversity, will soon commence with a focus on the sustainable reintroduction of the Great Hornbill into northern Thailand’s conservation areas. This critically endangered species, bred at Khao Kheow Open Zoo, will be released with GPS tracking devices developed by GISTDA, enabling precise monitoring of its adaptation in the wild. 

BSRC’s commitment to environmental sustainability aligns with its vision to "shape a sustainable future with premier energy through innovative solutions." The Great Hornbill, as a focal species in this initiative, symbolises the company's dedication to fostering a thriving natural environment for future generations.

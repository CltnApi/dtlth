Following the legalisation of **same-sex marriage** in Thailand, a landmark moment for the LGBTQ+ community, actors **Both** and **Newyear** announced their engagement on social media.

Thailand passed the marriage equality bill on June 18th, 2024 making it the first country in Southeast Asia to legalise same-sex marriage. This grants same-sex couples the same legal, financial and medical rights and protections as heterosexual couples.

**Nattapong "Both" Chinsoponsap** and **Kitiwhut "Newyear" Sawutdimilin** shared their engagement video on TikTok on June 27th. The video went viral, amassing over five million views. The couple became popular for their roles in the 2021 Thai drama series _**"Top Secret Together"**_, where they play an onscreen couple in a story that follows five couples, each with their own concealed secrets and unique perspectives on love.

Both and Newyear's relationship started in 2012 with a simple Instagram comment. Newyear commented on Both's posts, and the couple have been together ever since. To further show their love and commitment to one another, they started a joint YouTube channel, creating lifestyle vlogs and other content together.

Both and Newyear's journey to engagement reflects the progress Thailand has made towards LGBTQ+ rights. Their story serves as an inspiration to many couples in Thailand and around the world.

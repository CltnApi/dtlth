Master the 3 C's, your key to glory

From the feedback received it seems like the psychological side of the game is perhaps the most important area of golf that requires a golfer's full understanding. As previously explained, if you arrive at the 1st tee without possessing the 3 C's --Confidence, Competence & Capability, you'll be just praying for a good score.

Confidence is a feeling produced by fully comprehending your swing and having a commanding control of all the movements involved in propelling the ball in the direction you wish it to go in. And when a mishit occurs, it can be rationally analysed and mentally rectified before you hit your next shot.

Competence comes from the experience of bringing in reasonable scores, even when the planets are not aligned. Competence also comes from having done it before, so you know all the mental feelings you'll be facing and how to overcome them.

Capability stems from knowing that your swing and ability is more than capable of negotiating successfully all the various holes that are in front of you. Additionally, you know how to build a good score whilst dealing effortlessly with all the negativity of the golfing demons that golf can throw at you during a round of 18 holes.

**Out of Bounds:** Some golfing partners come into your life as blessings, others come out as lessons.

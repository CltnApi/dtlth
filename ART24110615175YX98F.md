Hollywood actor **Russell Crowe**, who has endeared himself to Thais in recent years with his enthusiastic online posts about the country, is back in Bangkok.

Crowe posted a photo of himself on Wednesday evening with the famous Michelin-starred restaurateur [Jay Fai](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2892811/starred-chef-jay-fai-denies-shes-retiring-closing-her-restaurant), who has been in the news herself after unfounded reports spread that she was ready to call it quits.

“She is an absolute rockstar!” Crowe said on his X account.

“Bangkok remains an exhilarating experience. So nice to be back in amazing Thailand!!”

Crowe first created a much-needed buzz for Thailand in October 2021 when he [arrived to film a movie](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2198715/russell-crowe-in-phuket-bangkok), just ahead of the country’s reopening to foreign visitors on Nov 1 that year after a long Covid-induced shutdown.

The Academy Award winner issued numerous tweets, posting pictures, video and commentary from the Bangkok and Phuket shooting locations of _The Greatest Beer Run Ever_.

A series of “Lost in Bangkok” tweets also showed the actor exploring numerous attractions, famous and not so famous, in the capital.  

Crowe told his 2.7 million followers that he had never visited Thailand, although he had transited in Bangkok six times.

A year later, he also made a cameo TV appearance quizzing candidates running to become the governor of Bangkok about what they would do to make the city more appealing.

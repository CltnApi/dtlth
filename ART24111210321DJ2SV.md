Bangkok's annual light and digital-art festival, "Awakening Bangkok", is returning for its seventh year with the theme "One Light, One Rising".

Building on the success of 2023, the festival returns to Phra Nakhon district for the second consecutive year, showcasing 36 light and digital-art installations that promise to captivate both Thai and international tourists.

The organisers are confident that this year’s festival will attract at least as many visitors as last year, generating income for local communities and boosting the area’s economy, all contributing toward Thailand’s economic goals.

Discover the Route of Awakening Bangkok 2024

The tour begins at Yodpiman River Walk, featuring eight installations across two floors. Visitors then head to the Pak Khlong Talat area and nearby piers to view four more displays.

Continuing along Sanam Chai Road, nine installations are set up from Museum Siam to Saranrom Park. Exiting the park, visitors can stroll to Feung Nakorn Road, Prang Phuthorn, and Prang Nara, where seven more artworks await.

The route then links to three installations between the Bangkok City Hall and Rommaninat Park, concluding at Rommaninat Park, which was newly added this year with five displays.

Along the way, visitors can support the community by dining at local restaurants, cafes, street-food vendors, and bars.

Additional amenities include registration points, concert stages, restrooms, and a complimentary tuk-tuk shuttle service between major display sites for those who prefer not to walk.

For maps, visitors can pick up a brochure at registration points at Yodpiman River Walk and Rommaninat Park. A QR code on the brochure links to Google Maps for easy navigation, or they can scan another code to access the Awakening Web App, which provides information on local eateries and details of each \\installation for an enhanced viewing experience.

Festival director Pongsiri Hetrakul said: “We believe that light and digital art not only revitalise historic districts but also spark inspiration within the community.

“This marks the seventh year of Awakening Bangkok and the second year it will be held in Phra Nakhon district. After an overwhelming response in 2023 across three main routes – Sanam Chai, Bamrung Muang and Feung Nakorn – the festival saw its highest attendance to date.”

This year, the route expands into Sam Yot with four interconnected paths, each representing one of four sub-themes: Sustainability, Prosperity, Inclusivity, and Positivity. The event will feature 36 installations by both Thai and international artists, including students from various universities.

A special highlight this year is a digital-art collaboration with Marimekko, a renowned Finnish fashion and lifestyle brand.

Thanapong Jirapanichkul, chief executive of Tanachira Retail Corporation Pcl, said: “Tanachira is honoured to be part of Awakening Bangkok 2024. This year is particularly meaningful as it celebrates the 60th anniversary of Marimekko’s iconic Unikko floral print. This vibrant floral pattern, which symbolises both the brand and deeply meaningful art, reflects the simplicity of nature, culture, and unique ways of life.

“To commemorate this occasion, Marimekko, in collaboration with Alternate Reality Studio, will project the Unikko design digitally on the façade of Museum Siam, a culturally significant building in Thailand. This is in line with other major global landmarks featuring Unikko, celebrating art and culture’s borderless connections.”

The annual light and digital-art festival, “Awakening Bangkok 2024”, is free for all visitors from November 8-17 between 6pm and 11pm. Experience Bangkok’s historic districts in a new light across 10 nights along Sanam Chai, Bamrung Muang, Feung Nakorn, and Sam Yot.

The festival is conveniently accessible by MRT (Sanam Chai and Sam Yot stations).

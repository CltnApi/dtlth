The Royal Forest Department has bought locally-made weapons from the Ministry of Defence, saying it was the first time the department has obtained modern submachine guns for the protection of over 32 million rai of the country's forest zone.

The department and the Defence Industry and Energy Centre last week held a handover ceremony of 20 NIN9 submachine guns.

The weapon was designed and developed by the centre under the government's policy on strengthening the domestic weapons industry for self-reliance in defence weapons development.

Bannarak Sermthong, the department's deputy chief, said 408 forest protection units were created nationwide to protect and preserve the forest areas from encroachment and illegal logging.

However, their limited stock of weapons and old equipment have posed problems, Mr Bannarak said.

"If these new NIN9 guns prove a good fit for our operation, we will ask the cabinet for a budget for more purchases," he said.

He said the department decided to go with the NIN9s because of their light weight and durability.

The guns are also resistant to heavy rainfall and dust, which makes them perfectly suited for forest patrol operations, he said.

He said the price is around 95,000 baht per unit, cheaper than imported weapons which cost around 120,000 per unit.

The Defence Industry and Energy Centre Commander Lt Gen Pawarit Panthong said the move is a significant step to support the domestic arms industry and the department's mission to protect and preserve the forest.

The centre would train the department's forest patrol team on how to use and maintain the weapon properly, said Lt Gen Pawarit.

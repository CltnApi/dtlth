Two cruise liners with over 2,000 tourists have arrived at Koh Samui in Surat Thani, with at least 10 ships scheduled to visit the island until next month.

The popular resort island welcomed 1,924 international visitors on MS Noordam, operated by US-based Holland America Line, at Nathon pier in tambon Ang Thong on Friday.

Another ship, the MS Seven Seas Explorer from US-based Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, brought 750 visitors and marked its second arrival at the beach.

The atmosphere became vibrant as tourists arrived, with over 100 vehicles — taxis, buses and trucks — provided for their one-day trip.

Nittharat Wanitcharoen, director of Tourism Authority of Thailand's (TAT) Koh Samui office, said 10 cruise ships are scheduled to visit from mid-November to next month, bringing about 7,500 passengers to the island.

Each visitor is expected to spend about 5,000 baht in a day on transportation, food and souvenirs, which could generate around 35 million baht in total spending, she said.

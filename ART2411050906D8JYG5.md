ONE Championship’s Denis Puric glad to have ‘real challenge’ against ‘beast’ Elias Mahmoudi at Fight Night 26

Denis Puric says ONE Championship fans are in for “fireworks” when he faces Elias Mahmoudi next month in a mouthwatering matchup with potential title implications.

“The Bosnian Menace”, who is ranked No 2 in the flyweight Muay Thai division, will defend his spot against “The Sniper” at ONE Fight Night 26 on December 7.

The 39-year-old will leave his home in Canada next week to prepare for the fight in Phuket, knowing victory could earn him another crack at Rodtang Jitmuangnon.

Puric battled to a unanimous decision loss against “The Iron Man” at June’s ONE 167 event in Bangkok’s Impact Arena. But that was under kickboxing rules, and Rodtang’s belt could be on the line this time.

“I can’t wait to get back in there. But I know I have a tough task ahead of me,” Puric told the Bangkok Post, however.

“Elias, I think, is one of the best guys in the division. I’m looking forward to the fight. These are the fights I want – a real challenge.”

No 5-ranked Mahmoudi is coming off an impressive last-gasp, spinning back fist knockout of Taiki Naito with just seconds remaining in the third round.

The Algerian’s victory in August earned him a US$50,000 performance bonus, and was all the more remarkable given he went to the hospital immediately after the fight and was diagnosed with dengue fever.

“I like Elias, I like his style,” Puric added. “The kid is a beast. I can’t wait to share the ring with him at Lumpinee Stadium.

“It will be a good fight for the fans. Fireworks. The fans are in for a treat. Watch it, freaks.”

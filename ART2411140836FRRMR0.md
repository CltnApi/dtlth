**Eco-Friendly Digital Loy Krathong Events**

Here are the highlights:

**Celebrate Loy Krathong from Anywhere (Online)!**

For green enthusiasts, Bangkok invites everyone to participate in the Loy Krathong festival in 2024 by floating krathongs online from anywhere. Enjoy the beauty of Bangkok's parks in an environmentally friendly way that reduces waste and pollution. Visit the Greener Bangkok website at [https://greener.bangkok.go.th](https://greener.bangkok.go.th) to choose from 34 parks and select a Krathong style you like, honouring the Water Goddess and making a wish on this important Thai festival.

Bangkok also offers a special “Krathong Collection Game,” where you can select an area to collect virtual krathongs and enjoy fun items. Start collecting on Friday, November 15, 2024, at 5pm, until midnight on Sunday, November 17, 2024, for a chance to win limited-edition eco-friendly prizes.

**Avoid Bread and Foam Krathongs: Use Natural, Biodegradable Materials**

Following the 2023 Loy Krathong festival, where excessive bread krathongs were floated in park ponds, especially at Santiphap Park, which harmed aquatic life and took nearly four months to restore, Bangkok requests citizens to use natural materials for krathongs and avoid foam and bread. Bread krathongs are challenging to clean up, easily disintegrate, may contain harmful dyes, and reduce oxygen in the water as they sink, endangering fish and the ecosystem.

Additionally, Bangkok encourages a sustainable celebration by floating one krathong per group or family to minimize waste. Last year, the city collected a total of 639,828 krathongs, a 67,226 increase (11.74%) from 2022. Of these, 618,951 (96.74%) were made from natural materials, while 20,877 (3.26%) were foam. For this year’s collection on November 15, 2024, Bangkok's Environmental and Drainage Departments, along with district offices, will mobilize staff to collect krathongs from the Chao Phraya River, canals, and ponds in parks across Bangkok, completing sorting by 6am on November 16.

**Campaign for 5 Safety Standards and Prepared Personnel and Equipment for Public Safety**

In terms of public safety, Bangkok is promoting the “5 Safety Standards” campaign, which includes “3 Pollution-Free” and “2 Safety Measures.” The 3 Pollution-Free standards are 1. Bread-Free Krathongs (no floating bread krathongs in ponds or lakes within Bangkok’s parks), 2. No Non-Natural Materials (avoid foam, pins, nails, and staples), and 3. Air Pollution-Free – Energy Reduction (reduce travel by celebrating Loy Krathong in nearby parks and minimize incense burning).

The 2 Safety Measures are 1. Firework-Free and Sky Lantern-Free zones, 2. Safe Piers and Floating Docks.

In addition to this campaign, Bangkok has ensured safety at piers, inspecting them for stability and readiness, checking waterfront and waste collection areas, and maintaining CCTV systems in parks. Municipal officers will be present for public safety. Hospitals under the Medical Department are prepared for emergencies around the clock, with medical units stationed at the joint command centres. Each station will have five staff members equipped with fire engines, rescue vehicles, lighting vehicles, and communication tools. Each pier and dock point along the Chao Phraya River will have two staff members with life-saving gear, life jackets, buoys, and ropes. Additionally, three 38-foot fireboats will patrol the Chao Phraya River from Rama VII Bridge to Rama IX Bridge.

Fireworks, rockets, firecrackers, sky lanterns, and similar items are prohibited without permission. Special units inspect facilities that produce, store or sell fireworks, and safety checks are required at event venues and entertainment establishments. Parents are advised to supervise children closely, and attendees are encouraged to abstain from alcohol and intoxicants.

If you encounter an injured person or medical emergency, call 1669 (Bangkok Erawan Center and the nationwide emergency hotline). For fire or other emergencies, call 199 (Rama Radio Center, Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, Bangkok).

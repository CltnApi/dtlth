Workers protest over late wages

Hundreds of workers protested in front of Government House yesterday, demanding the government's help as 10,000 of them have not been paid for eight months by subcontractors of a clean fuel project in Chon Buri.

Demonstrators from the Federation of Subcontractors, representing at least 28 subcontractor firms, submitted the petition to Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. It was received by Justice Minister Pol Col Tawee Sodsong and Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister for Political Affairs Somkid Chueakong.

Thitapat Reewatpatthananan, secretary of the federation, read the statement and asked the government for assistance. She said the main contractor, a consortium of Petrofac South East Asia Pte Ltd, Saipem Singapore Pte Ltd, and Samsung E&A (Thailand) Co Ltd, which Thai Oil hired to construct its Clean Fuel Project (CFP) in Sri Racha district, had not paid the group of subcontractors involved in the construction of the oil refinery.

The subcontractors are facing serious problems despite having already delivered the work according to the contract. The work from February till now has a total value of several billion baht, which has severely affected the financial status of more than 10,000 workers.

There is a long-term liquidity shortage as a result of unfair contracts that require subcontractors to continue working even if the main contractor has not paid the instalments. Some subcontractors are also obliged to continue working without payment to avoid being sued for damages.

"We urge the government to help in this matter to alleviate the suffering of our 10,000 workers who have not yet received their wages for eight months," she said.

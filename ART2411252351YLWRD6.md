While enjoying winter temperatures, visitors to Nakhon Ratchasima can immerse in a charming Isan-style town surrounded by lush mountain ranges and beautiful flower fields as part of Jim Thompson Farm 2024: Isan Calling, which runs from Dec 7 until Jan 1.

Situated in Pak Thong Chai district, the massive 600 rai farm has collaborated with 19 prominent artists from the Isan, Northern and Central regions to create a creative art space that brings together distinctive Isan traditions and modern elements. It will be filled with a wide range of entertaining leisure activities, art installations and cultural performances.

Long regarded as a favourite photo backdrop, the "Vibrant Flower Fields" allows visitors to get lost in the vast stretch of the cosmos and native Isan blooms. As trees become living sculptures, "Art On Farm" celebrates the allure of Isan culture and nature by showcasing a selection of striking art installations by 19 well-known artists from Thailand and abroad.

Next to the rice fields, the "Joyful Music Stage" will serve as a major entertainment venue, where molam artists such as Bo Dam Lam Sing and Wiang Na Naruemon will bring authentic Isan spirit to a laid-back farm setting. Meanwhile, the "Lam Loke - The World Of Molam" exhibition will immerse visitors in Isan culture through traditional music and performances.

A historic 32-seat bus, which was used to transport Jim Thompson's textile workers, is transformed into a mobile art gallery for the "Molam Bus" exhibition to showcase the artistry of molam across the country.

Also, the "Rice Is Life" exhibition will feature 50 unique rice varieties and traditional farming methods, a towering 14m rice castle, traditional rice mills and innovative rice-based products. On weekends, visitors can join rice tasting workshops and observe local processing techniques.

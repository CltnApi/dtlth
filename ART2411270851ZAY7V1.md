PST Pizza Studio Tamaki, the renowned Tokyo-Napoli style pizzeria from Japan, is opening in Bangkok in December at Town Hall Sukhumvit 49. Known for its unique twist on traditional Neapolitan pizza, PST uses flour imported from Japan and Okinawa salt, which gives rise to a light, airy dough. Each dough ball is proofed for 30 hours and ingredients like cheese, prosciutto and olive oil are imported from Italy to honour traditional flavours, along with a wood-fired oven from Japan.

Helming the kitchen is a Japanese head chef and pizzaiolo and the menu will mirror that of PST Tokyo, featuring signature pizzas like the Tamaki and Special Bianca, alongside lasagna, tiramisu, and monthly special pizzas with seasonal Japanese ingredients. The restaurant’s cozy interior fuses Japanese and Italian elements, with both table and counter seating, and an open kitchen. The second-floor bar will offer a  selection of wines, sake and cocktails specifically chosen to pair with the pizzas.

With a keen eye on field-to-table ingredients and the ancient art of charcoal grilling, chef Pod's menu revolves around the sustainable, ethical sourcing of the best Thai ingredients, celebrating the terroir of the country. Expect each dish to be rooted in charcoal grilling, like coconut wood charcoal from Prachuap Khiri Khan and lychee wood charcoal from Nan.

"My dishes are based on the ingredient. I first source the product and then create the dish. Since I am really a fine dining chef, the dishes are not your usual Thai fare. Like the Surat Thani blue swimmer crab salad. I really like that crab and Thai people love seafood and salt. So, I decided to serve the crab with a chimichurri and edible ferns. Traditionally this dish is a relish but I have also added some charcoal-grilled fresh coconut strips to the salad," says the chef.

Standouts include Jasmine Wagyu beef from Farm ArunSupa in Maha Sarakham, known for its delicate marbling developed from a jasmine rice diet, and baby gem leaves cultivated by organic farmers in the mineral-rich soil of Chiang Mai's hills. Other highlights include organic dairy products from Khao Yai. Other must-try's include the signature Fire skewers, inspired by the bold flavours of Thai street food cooked over charcoal. “We bring the essence of Thai ingredients to every dish,” says chef Pod. “By using traditional charcoal grilling techniques, I draw on my roots and my journey through kitchens around the world to transform the freshest ingredients into flavours that are both bold and authentic, reimagined in a modern way.” 

To complement these mains, guests can choose from a selection of sides, such as fried brown rice with salty fish and smoked mashed potatoes, along with distinctive sauces like spicy tamarind and chili pepper and macadamia chimichurri. A selection of vegetarian dishes is also available. For dessert, indulge in Chiang Rai grilled Phulae pineapple served with passion fruit gazpacho and basil sorbet, and mango crispy rice, blending traditional flavours with a modern touch. Though service is a tad lacking, it is one of the best places in Bangkok to enjoy the river breeze and stunning sunset views.

The signatures feature innovative drinks like the Mariachi Pizza, crafted with a bell pepper-infused rum, mezcal and an intriguing mix of bianco vermouth, white peppercorn tincture and cream cracker. Another highlight is the Kahwa, a blend of lacto-fermented blackberry and Kashmiri Kahwa tea-infused gin, with notes of grapefruit and rosemary. Tonka is a smooth fusion of vanilla and tonka-infused Ketel One vodka, Malibu and Midori, with a punch of passionfruit and cream. The Nitty-Gritty is a gutsy mix of aged rums — Flor de Cana, Kraken and Mount Gay — shaken with Ladi Pao (rustic bread) and Verjus, then served with a waffle and a slice of pineapple for a bold finish.

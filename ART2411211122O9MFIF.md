Bridgestone’s new concept model of the lunar rover tire 

Bridgestone Corporation has made a significant leap in innovation with the development of its new lunar rover tire, designed to withstand the extreme conditions of the moon's surface. The concept tire was unveiled at the 39th Space Symposium, held in Colorado Springs, United States, from 8–11 April 2024. This event, the largest of its kind in the US, provided a platform for Bridgestone to showcase its advanced technology in the Japan’s Space Industry booth, organised by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).  

The new tire, a product of Bridgestone’s commitment to "mastering road contact," incorporates next-generation "Air Free®" technology. Inspired by the natural efficiency of camel footpads, the design enhances traction on the moon’s regolith, the fine sand that covers its surface. A soft, metal-based felt material on the tread provides superior grip, while the introduction of thin metal spokes and segmented tread structures ensures durability and manoeuvrability in the lunar environment. 

Bridgestone optimised the tire’s skeletal structure using advanced simulations, allowing the metal spokes to flex without compromising durability. This design not only minimises strain but also enhances performance by increasing contact area and reducing sinking, addressing the unique challenges posed by the moon’s rocky terrain, vacuum conditions, and extreme temperature fluctuations. 

The project forms part of Bridgestone’s exploratory business strategy outlined in its 2024–2026 Mid Term Business Plan. By leveraging its decades of experience in mobility solutions and motorsport technologies, the company aims to redefine the possibilities of lunar mobility while developing innovations that could one day benefit Earth-based applications. 

Bridgestone’s corporate commitment, the "Bridgestone E8 Commitment," underpins this initiative, with a focus on “Extension: Committed to nonstop mobility and innovation that keeps people and the world moving ahead” The company hopes this pioneering project will inspire international collaboration and expand its footprint in the burgeoning space industry. 

The lunar rover tire, now in its second generation, represents a significant step forward for Bridgestone, not just as a leader in tyre technology but as a key contributor to space exploration. With its advanced design and durability, the tire supports lunar missions aimed at furthering humanity’s understanding of the moon and beyond.

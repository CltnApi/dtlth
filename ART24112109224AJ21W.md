Juneyao Auto (Thailand) Co., Ltd., a manufacturer and distributor of electric vehicles under Juneyao Group, the parent company of Juneyao Airlines, one of the leading private airlines in China, officially launched its intelligent electric vehicle brand. The launch features the first electric vehicle model, “JY AIR,” a new dimension in smart mobility. Focusing on the needs of modern drivers who seek cutting-edge technology, comfortable, safe, and eco-friendly vehicles. This marks a significant milestone in the company's history as expanding the business from transportation, finance, and education to the development of automotive innovations to meet future smart mobility demands. 

Mr. Wang Junjin, Chairman of Juneyao Group, stated, “Juneyao is an organisation with a solid foundation in transportation, consumer goods, education, financial services, and technological innovation, focusing on sustainable business development in all aspects. Juneyao is well-recognised as a forward-thinking organisation with a vision to benefit society. With our experience in the commercial airline business, Juneyao has expanded into the automotive market. In Q2 2022, we bought YUDO Auto, which has been active in China’s market since 2015 with the first model, the YUDO YUNTU, a compact electric SUV.” 

However, Juneyao has seriously ventured into the automotive sector since November last year, aiming to develop and offer high-efficiency, environmentally friendly electric vehicles. The group's committed strategy focuses on advanced technology research and development to create innovations that meet consumer needs and support the shift towards clean energy in the automotive industry. Additionally, Juneyao aims to expand internationally to strengthen its position and compete in this exciting industry. 

This time, Juneyao is ready to present its first electric vehicle, the JY AIR, a new form of travel featuring intelligent technology designed to bring joy in every dimension. Combining innovative driving with comfort as First Class travel. 

**Highlight Features and Cutting-Edge Technology of JY AIR.** 

The JY AIR electric car is designed for maximum performance in both driving efficiency and safety. Coming with the Crystal OS, an operating system developed by Jun Yao's research and development team. This Crystal OS features intelligent control and operation, allowing the driver to manage all functions at the touch of a fingertip. Including controlling the lights, windows, and tailgate, and also supporting real-time adjustments based on road conditions, providing a smooth driving experience in all situations. 

The SKY platform, with five-star safety, is another feature that enhances confidence in safety. This platform can develop new vehicle models globally, ensuring high performance and superior safety, thereby providing a competitive edge. By covering a wide range of vehicle types from A-class to C-class sedan, SUV, coupe, MPVs, and other categories. 

The Level 2+ autonomous driving technology equipped in the JY AIR ensures confident automated driving. Including advanced driver-assistance features such as adaptive cruise control to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, parking assistance for effortless parking, blind-spot warnings to reduce the risk of accidents, and lane-keeping control to maximise safety during driving. This model has also achieved top-level safety certifications, earning 5-star ratings from both NCAP and E-NCAP, providing confidence for drivers and passengers on every journey. 

**Enjoy Luxurious Design and Superior Comfort.** 

Beyond the cutting-edge technology, the JY AIR is designed to meet the lifestyle needs of drivers seeking comfort and luxury. With aerodynamic ONE BOX design ensures quiet driving and excellent aerodynamics. The interior features high-quality materials and luxurious textures, offering spaciousness and tranquillity while reducing external noise, providing maximum comfort for both the driver and passengers. 

Moreover, the cabin innovations include a 3D vehicle control system that delivers a highly responsive driving experience. Allowing for one-touch control of lights, windows, and the tailgate. Additionally, a 2.072-square-meter panoramic roof enhances the sense of openness and comfort. 

JY AIR is available in four colours: Moon White, Meteorite Blue, Aurora Green, and Galactic Black. Additionally, there are special promotions for early reservations to ensure consumers feel confident in the after-sales service and the value of their investment in this new electric vehicle model.

CHIANG MAI - Soldiers seized 400,000Â **speed pills** that had been abandoned in a garden in Fang district of this northern province on Friday.

Lt Gen Kittiphong Chuenchaichon, the 3rd Army Area commander, said the Pha Muang task force was alerted on Friday morning by a local resident who had spotted unfamiliar fertiliser sacks at the entrance of his garden at Nong Om village in tambon Mae Kha of Fang district.

When the troops opened the sacks, they found each contained 200,000 speed pills. The seized drugs were handed over to the Fang police station, said Lt Gen Kittiphong, also commander of a drug suppression unit in the North.

Illegal activity has picked up this year as some drug smugglers are in dire need of money to repair houses damaged by the massive flooding in border areas, he said. This has led to the smuggling of large amounts of drugs from the border into northern provinces.

Authorities have intensified prevention and suppression measures to prevent the influx of drugs into the country, said Lt Gen Kittiphong.

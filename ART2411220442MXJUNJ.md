**Dr. Nattapol Rangsitpol, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Industry and chairman of the METALEX and the Thailand Industrial Conference** opening ceremony, emphasized Thailand's commitment to transitioning into an era of advanced technology within manufacturing and services. He noted that as many countries worldwide have revolutionized their industries towards Industry 5.0 by adopting advanced technologies focused on cost efficiency, profit generation, and environmental concerns, the industrial sector, businesses, and entrepreneurs must accelerate the development of their competitive capabilities and adapt to the intense competitive landscape. To remain competitive amidst challenges like media, trade, financial, and technological conflicts, Thai industries must prioritize advancing their capabilities and integrating cutting-edge machinery and technologies.

The Ministry of Industry has placed significant emphasis on developing and transforming manufacturing machinery to enhance efficiency across the entire supply chain. In today's industrial landscape, competitiveness is driven by intelligence, precision, reduced waste, value addition, and environmental responsibility. This transformation can be achieved by implementing suitable machinery and technology to optimize the manufacturing sector.

In his speech, he emphasized that the rapid global changes pose significant challenges that Thailand must adapt to. The country needs to proactively drive rapid and effective changes to enable the Thai industrial sector to overcome limitations and compete in the global market.

"Industrial transformation is a key policy in driving the operations of the Ministry of Industry and the industrial sector towards a new era of environmentally friendly economy. This is achieved through collaboration with the Industrial Development Foundation to promote and support government agencies in enhancing the competitiveness of the Thai industrial sector. Various mechanisms are utilized, such as consulting, training, research and development, inspection, testing, certification, energy conservation, and environmental preservation, as well as other related services. These initiatives are facilitated through eight specialized network institutes focusing on critical industries in the country, with the goal of driving sustainable growth and global recognition for Thailand's industrial sector.”

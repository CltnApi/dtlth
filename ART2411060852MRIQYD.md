4EVE’s Origins
--------------

**4EVE** started out with a reality television show called _4EVE Girl Group Star_, developed by **XOXO Entertainment**, a subsidiary of **Workpoint Entertainment**. The show pitched 20 contestants for a chance to win a spot in the 7-member group. The first episode aired on 13th July 2020, and lasted until 5th  October 2020.

Each of the members embodies a distinctly different persona. The members of **4EVE** include **Mind (Atitaya Tribudarak)**, **Jorin Kampeephan**, **Taaom (Benyapa Unjit)**, **Hanna Rosenbroom**, **Fai (Nattaya Buttura)**, **Punch (Tipanan Nilsiam)**, and **Aheye (Korranid Laosubinprasoet)**.

'Live Airport' project offers cultural flair for travellers

A "Live Airport" concept has been piloted at Phitsanulok and Nan airports to promote both provinces' cultural identities while creating sustainable economic benefits for local communities.

Deputy Transport Minister Manaporn Charoensri and a group of officials from the Department of Airports (DoA) visited Phitsanulok Airport on Thursday to inspect the Live Airport activities there.

The Live Airport project was launched in the northern provinces of Phitsanulok and Nan on Nov 1.

Ms Manaporn said the concept stemmed from the idea of promoting airports as not just an embarkation point but also the first gate to each province.

It is a collaborative project between the DoA, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) office, and local businesses to increase tourist attractions and promote community participation through cultural activities and festivals within the airport area.

She said she had ordered the DoA to allocate space at both Phitsanulok and Nan airports for local businesses and artisans to showcase their products as part of the project to help generate income for locals.

Folk art performances and workshops on arts and crafts were also to be organised to create a lively atmosphere.

According to DoA director-general Danai Raungsorn, Phitsanulok's Live Airport project was represented through a giant water lily-inspired interior motif, ambience sound effects to enhance visitors' experience, and a lineup of year-round cultural activities.

The Live Airport project is also in line with the government's "Aew Nua Khon La Khrung" (Travelling North at Half Price) scheme to boost tourism in 17 northern provinces, said Ms Manaporn.

She said the DoA was also instructed to cooperate with local airports, communities, and related sectors for the project expansion while focusing on other aspects of airport development, including enhancing airport infrastructure to meet international standards.

The development plans include an increase of feeder buses to improve travel to airports for travellers.

Currently, the Phitsanulok Land Transportation Office has arranged feeder buses at the airport that link it with central Phitsanulok and the second Phitsanulok Bus Terminal.

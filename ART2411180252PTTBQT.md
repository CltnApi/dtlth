**Mr Eric Mansion, General Manager, Pharma Business of South-East Asia & India (SEA&I) and Multi-Country Organization (MCO) Lead**, shared, “At Sanofi, a global leader in healthcare innovation with operations in over 70 countries, we are united by our purpose: ‘We Chase the Miracles of Science to Improve People’s Lives.’ Our commitment to research and development propels us to deliver best-in-class solutions, using advanced technology and a patient-centric approach. In the rapidly growing SEA&I region, with over 2 billion people, we understand that healthcare access, environmental care, and social impact are all essential.

**Mr Charles Trolliet**, who supports and drives social impact projects in Thailand, remarked, “Sanofi Thailand strives to provide Thai patients with equitable, sustainable access to innovative treatments and has launched two pioneering projects this year:

1.  **Sanofi Planet Care Upcycling Programme:** In response to global warming and severe climate change, we have partnered with six leading hospitals to encourage diabetes patients to return used insulin pens. These will be repurposed, reducing plastic waste. The programme has gained significant traction, and we are excited to expand it further next year.
2.  **Kids & Diabetes in Schools (KiDS):** This global campaign, initiated by Sanofi and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), was introduced in Thailand this June to raise awareness of diabetes among children and youth, encouraging healthier lifestyles through exercise, proper nutrition, and adequate rest. We collaborated with the Diabetes Association of Thailand and the Medical Service Department of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) to launch the project through ‘Train the Trainers’ workshops. Sanofi volunteers also implemented the KiDS programme in a Bangkok secondary school to mark World Diabetes Day.”

**Ms Mantana Tanprasert, Head of Vaccines for Thailand and Myanmar,** added, “This award inspires us to deepen our commitment to scientific innovation that enhances the health of Thai society. Our efforts have yielded tangible results, from providing life-changing treatment options and promoting health literacy to advocating for life-course immunisation, especially for vulnerable groups like infants, children, and the elderly. We reaffirm our commitment to improving the health and well-being of communities in Thailand.”

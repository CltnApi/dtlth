In the presence of the Minister of Agriculture, Food Sovereignty and Forestry (MASAF), Mr Francesco Lollobrigida, the Italian Embassy in Bangkok and the Italian Trade Agency jointly hosted a lavish celebration of Italian cuisine's candidacy as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. This follows the nomination submitted by MASAF and the Ministry of Culture (MIC) on 23 March 2023.

The initiative took advantage of the visit of Italy’s legendary ship, Amerigo Vespucci, to Phuket and Minister Lollobrigida's presence in Thailand to promote the candidacy of Italian cuisine through an event aimed at an audience of high-profile personalities. The grand evening saw Italian Ambassador to Thailand, Mr Paolo Dionisi, and Italian Trade Commissioner for Thailand, Ms Paola Guida, welcoming distinguished guests, including Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, Mr Anutin Charnvirakul; Minister of Social Development and Human Security, Mr Varawuth Silpa-archa; Minister of Education, Pol Gen Permpoon Chidchob; as well as members of the diplomatic corps, the Thai-Italian Chamber of Commerce, opinion leaders, influencers, and local and Italian food and wine entrepreneurs.

Tradition, variety, biodiversity, and sustainability, alongside PDO/PGI products of excellence that Italian cuisine offers to the world, are the central themes of the candidacy. Fittingly, the event was held at the Grand Hyatt Erawan Bangkok, home to the “Salvia” restaurant, which proudly holds the “Ospitalità Italiana” certificate. Chef Roberto Parentela of Salvia coordinated the dinner, crafting a special menu that showcased Italian culinary traditions from northern to southern Italy, including Sardinia and Sicily. The menu featured authentic ingredients and recipes from different Italian regions.

The event featured both presentation and networking moments, including a welcome cocktail attended by approximately 200 guests. During the evening, Minister Lollobrigida awarded 15 Chef Ambassadors for their contributions to promoting and raising awareness of Italian cuisine in Thailand.

The celebration also included a performance by tenor Waku Kanazawa, who sang famous Italian arias accompanied by Thai pianist Rasikamol Sriyapong. Additionally, a vibrant exhibition showcased a wide range of authentic Italian products, from wines to preserves, pasta to truffles, liqueurs to Italian caviar—all already available in Thailand.

This event in Bangkok is part of the UNESCO roadshow promoting and celebrating Italian cuisine's candidacy as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. Previous stops have included New York, Doha, Las Vegas, Lyon, and Tokyo. The roadshow is organised by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Sovereignty and Forestry (MASAF) and the Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with MAECI, the Italian Trade Commission (ITA), the Ministry of Tourism, and ENIT.

But that is not all. The extraordinary flavours of Italian cuisine will be celebrated further during Italian Cuisine Week 2024, the annual celebration of Italy’s culinary excellence, running from 16-22 November 2024.

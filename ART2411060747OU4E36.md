The Food and Drug Administration has seized more thanÂ 94,000 illegal Chinese products from dozens of shops in Bangkok over the past three months.

FDA deputy secretary-general Lertchai Lertvut said on Wednesday that FDA officials, police and Bangkok district officials raided 47 Chinese supermarkets in Bangkok from July 31 to Nov 4 and seized 94,476 illegal Chinese consumer products in 341 product categories. The goods were in breach of labelling regulations, he said.

Failure to show Thai-language labels on food products carries a fine of up to 30,000 baht, while the sellers of cosmetics without a Thai label are liable to a fine of up to 10,000 baht and/or jail term of up to one month, Mr Lertchai said.

He advised consumers, for their own safety, to buy only products with Thai labels detailing food names, manufacturers, importers, manufacturing and expiry dates and FDA registration numbers.

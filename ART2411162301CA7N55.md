Anglo Singapore International School has achieved exceptional recognition at the 2024 Outstanding Cambridge Learner Awards, with one of its students receiving the prestigious “Best Across Three” award for outstanding A Level results. This distinction is awarded to students with the highest scores across their A Level subjects. Mr Nonthapat Upariputtanggoon, now studying Engineering at the University of Cambridge, UK, was celebrated as the top-performing A Level student by Cambridge International Education.

In addition to this top honour, Anglo Singapore International School celebrated seven other remarkable achievements:

1.  Top in the World for A Level Chemistry
2.  Top in the World for A Level Mathematics
3.  Top in the World for A Level Physics
4.  Top in the World for IGCSE Foreign Language Mandarin Chinese
5.  Top in Thailand for A Level Biology
6.  High Achievement in A Level Psychology
7.  High Achievement in AS Level Further Mathematics

Though relatively young among international schools in Thailand, Anglo Singapore International School has established a strong reputation for academic excellence, with students consistently earning Outstanding Cambridge Learner Awards over the past ten graduating classes. Recently, Anglo redefined its educational philosophy, transforming from a STEM leader (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) to a pioneer of the comprehensive STEAM-B model—integrating Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics with a focus on Business. This innovative framework merges creative disciplines with business acumen, equipping students with both analytical and creative skills essential for success in today’s dynamic world.

Supporting this model is the Anglo Pathway Programme, a dynamic mentorship initiative that revolutionises pastoral care. With a personalised 1:10 mentor-student ratio, the programme spans five critical pathways: Medicine and Life Sciences, Engineering and Sciences, Behavioural Sciences and Commerce, Art & Design, and Computer Science. This structured, student-focused guidance ensures that every Anglo student receives mentorship tailored to their unique aspirations and ambitions.

The STEAM-B education model, along with the Anglo Pathway Programme, has inspired a wide range of aspirations among Anglo’s graduates: 33% are pursuing Medicine, 33% Behavioural Science and Commerce, 19% Engineering and Sciences, 10% Computer Science, and 5% Art & Design. This diverse array reflects Anglo’s commitment to preparing students for a broad spectrum of future opportunities.

To mark this special occasion, Anglo is also proud to inaugurate its state-of-the-art 6-storey Building H. This new facility will help Anglo redefine educational history by transforming traditional classrooms into innovative “Learning Studios.” The building features a purpose-built gymnasium with two basketball courts, six badminton courts, two volleyball courts, and a running track. It also houses specialised laboratories for Biology, Physics, and Chemistry, providing students with hands-on learning experiences in advanced scientific study. Redesigned common areas serve as hubs for both study and relaxation, while a dedicated study hall provides a space for focused revision and review.

At Anglo, teaching and learning are guided by our core principles of the 2Ps: Pedagogy and Physical Space, coupled with High Quality Learning (HQL). These principles shape our classrooms to be more than spaces equipped with smart boards and seating; they encourage interaction, collaborative learning, and a student-centred approach. Our lesson plans focus on personalised learning, with stages that move from instruction to practice, application, and reflection. This approach emphasises both the abstraction and concretisation of learning content, ensuring that education goes beyond lectures and syllabus completion to foster deeper understanding and skill development.

This building stands as a testament to Anglo’s commitment to fostering learning and personal growth, enriching student life and interaction through these exceptional facilities. With the integration of the STEAM-B curriculum and the Anglo Pathway Programme, Anglo Singapore International School is charting an inspiring path forward, preparing the next generation of global thinkers, innovators, and leaders

Bitkub Capital Group Holdings is making waves again by launching billboard advertisements nationwide to celebrate and welcome developers, researchers, and blockchain technology enthusiasts from around the world attending the 7th Devcon conference. Titled "DEVCON Southeast Asia" and organised by the Ethereum Foundation, this annual gathering of Ethereum network developers takes place in Thailand from November 12-15, 2024, at Queen Sirikit National Convention Center in Bangkok.

Mr. Jirayut Srupsrisopa, Founder and Group CEO of Bitkub Capital Group Holdings, stated, "As pioneers in Thailand's digital asset and blockchain technology sector, Bitkub Capital Group is delighted that Thailand has been chosen to host Devcon 7, the blockchain industry's major annual event. This conference presents an excellent opportunity for Thai developers and the Web3 community to connect with global industry leaders and developers, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. It's a crucial chance to network with international business leaders gathering in Thailand, instead of pursuing them overseas. The numerous side events during Devcon further enhance business opportunities. Moreover, choosing Bangkok as the host city for Devcon 7 will stimulate greater interest in digital assets and blockchain technology throughout Southeast Asia, while positioning Thailand as a regional hub of digital assets and blockchain technology."

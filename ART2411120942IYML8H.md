A car rammed into pedestrians at a sports centre in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, leaving more than 10 dead and injuring nearly 100, with the driver detained at the scene, according to media reports.

Local police said investigations were under way into the incident that happened on Monday evening, in which the 62-year-old driver, surnamed Fan, was arrested, the Hong Kong-based _Ming Pao_ newspaper reported on Tuesday.

The incident occurred a day before a major air show opened in the city in southern Guangdong province, on the border with Macau.

_Ming Pao_ said the suspect’s motive has not been disclosed. The sports centre is a popular spot for local joggers and walkers, with private cars prohibited from entering the site.

Videos posted online immediately after the accident showed numerous people lying motionless in pools of blood. By late Monday night, however, Chinese media reports and images on social media had been deleted, and it is suspected that authorities were controlling information before the air show started.

The Chinese military’s new J-35 stealth fighter and J-15 carrier-based fighter jets are among the aircraft being shown at the biennial China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition, which will run through Sunday.

China has seen a spate of violent attacks on members of the public in recent months.

In September, a man went on a stabbing spree at a supermarket in Shanghai, killing three people and injuring several others.

In that same month, a 10-year-old J[apanese student died](https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2868663/japanese-boy-stabbed-in-china-dies) a day after he was stabbed near his school in southern China.

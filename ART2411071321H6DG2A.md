The Department of Business Development (DBD) at the Ministry of Commerce is teaming up with the police Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) to combat corporate **mule accounts** and **nominee** operations.

Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has issued a directive to curb cybercrime, focusing specifically on cracking down on corporate mule accounts often used by criminals to receive illicit funds, said Karom Polpornklang, a deputy spokesman for the Prime Minister’s Office. 

In response, the DBD signed a memorandum of understanding with the CIB to establish a cooperative framework aimed at targeting the creation of corporate mule accounts and the use of nominee services to conceal the identities of individuals behind criminal activities.

These joint efforts will streamline resources and legal powers across agencies, enhancing both preventive and punitive measures to effectively deter criminal activities, the two parties said.

According to Mr Karom, more fraudsters registering corporate entities to open mule accounts. These accounts are then used to receive funds from scam victims, often deceived by fraudulent call centres.

Recently, authorities identified 602 corporate mule accounts linked to losses exceeding 680 million baht.

In another development, the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) recently raided 21 safety deposit boxes at commercial banks in Lop Buri province, uncovering approximately 300 million baht in assets connected to money laundering by the “Mae Mon” online gambling network.

The assets included gold, land deeds, jewellery and 15 million baht in cash.

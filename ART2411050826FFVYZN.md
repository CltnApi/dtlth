George Jarvis earns ONE Championship contract as CEO Chatri changes his mind after after Rungrawee KO

George Jarvis earned a US$100,000 ONE Championship contract in dramatic style at ONE Friday Fights 85, after initially being denied by Chatri Sityodtong.

The ONE chairman and CEO relayed through commentator and in-ring interviewer Mitch Chilson that Jarvis was “close”, and that a call-up to the big time was “in his future”, after knocking out ONE contracted fighter Rungrawee Sitsongpeenong in the third round.

Jarvis said he “respected” Chatri’s decision but was clearly disappointed, despite winning a 350,000 baht bonus for his display in the lightweight Muay Thai clash at Lumpinee Stadium.

But in a shocking twist, Jarvis returned to the ring after the following fight and was told Chatri had changed his mind after talking to his team.

“Thank you, Chatri,” Jarvis said. “This is just the beginning. You are looking at the future king of the lightweight division.”

The 24-year-old Englishman’s beaming smile was in stark contrast to the mixture of disappointment and disbelief that had earlier swept his face when he realised he was not getting a contract.

He later cut a frustrated figure during his duties in the backstage media room at Lumpinee Stadium, but would return smiling once again to give a completely different set of interviews.

“I’ll be completely honest, I would have been more than happy today to walk away without a contract, because obviously I do believe Chatri is the main man,” Jarvis told the Bangkok Post. 

“He knows what’s best for his fighters. So if he did believe I needed a mother fight then I was happy to do so.

“But listen, I’m not gonna turn down a contract – if he wants to give it to me now, then even better. It means I’ve set up my future even earlier than before. 

"No matter what happened I would have been grateful, but to get both a contract and a bonus, I’m buzzing.

“This is exactly what we came here for. I don’t know what’s gonna be next now, hopefully I don’t have to go back in the ring again.”

Clearly not lacking in confidence, Jarvis reiterated his calls for an immediate title shot against lightweight Muay Thai champ Regian Eersel.

“Any of the top boys in the division,” he added. “Anyone who wants it can get it – 2025 is my year. 

“If he \[Chatri\] wants to throw me straight in there for a title shot let’s do it. If he wants to give me another challenge, let’s do it. Now I’m part of ONE Championship, whoever wants it can get it.”

Thailand’s **winter** will not be very cold this year, with temperatures about one degree Celsius higher than the average, according to the **Meteorological Department**.

The lowest mean daily minumum temperatures in the cool season that started on Sunday are expected to be 16-19C in the North and Northeast in January. Overall temperatures will be higher by 1C due to variable weather, the department said on Tuesday.

It said cooler weather had begun to cover the North and Northeast with the lowest maximum temperatures below 29C from Oct 29. The cooler air has since expanded to cover the Central Plains and the East.

Winds have switched to northeastern or easterly, and the distribution of rain continues to decrease. With these conditions, Thailand officially entered the cool season on Nov 3, said a notice signed by Sugunyanee Yavinchan, the department’s acting director-general.

However, rain is expected in some areas of upper Thailand in early November, while more showers with occasional heavy to very heavy rain are forecast in the South in November and December.

Somkhuan Tonjan, director of the department’s forecasting sub-division, said in an interview with ThaiPBS Online that the cool season this year was forecast not to be as cold as usual, with temperatures about 1C above the normal average.

It was a blessing for Thailand to be able to enter the cool season as the weather has been quite variable, given the transition from the from El Nino to La Nina weather pattern, said Mr Somkhuan.

The North and the Northeast will experience colder weather in December to January with a cold air mass from China spreading to cover Thailand until January, he said.

The expected mean daily minimum temperatures in January are as follows:

*   In the North, the mean daily minimum is expected to be 16-18C in Mae Hong Son, Chiang Rai, Phayao, Nan, Chiang Mai, Lamphang, Phrae, Lamphun, Sukhothai, Uttaradit, Phitsanulok, Tak, Kamphaeng Phet, Phichit and Phetchabun.
*   In the Northeast, temperatures are expected to be between 17 and 19C in Loei, Nong Khai, Bueng Kan, Nakhon Phanom, Sakon Nakhon, Nong Bua Lamphu, Udon Thani, Kalasin, Mukdahan, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen, Ubon Ratchathani, Maha Sarakham, Buri Ram, Roi Et, Yasothon, Amnat Charoen, Surin, Si Sa Ket and Nakhon Ratchasima.
*   In the Central Plains, temperatures are expected to be 20-22C in Nakhon Sawan, Uthai Thani, Chai Nat, Lop Buri, Saraburi, Ang Thong, Ayutthaya, Kanchanaburi, Suphan Buri, Nakhon Sawan, Lop Buri, Nakhon Pathom, Pathum Thani and Nonthaburi.
*   In the East, temperatures are expected to be 22-24C in Nakhon Nayok, Prachin Buri, Chachoengsao, Nakhon Nayok and Sa Kaeo.
*   In Bangkok and surrounding provinces, temperatures are expected to be around 23-25C.

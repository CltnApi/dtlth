**Engfa Waraha**, the winner of Miss Grand Thailand in 2022, has quickly established herself as a talented singer, model and actress. Her latest box office success has audiences praising the film. Let's dive into **Engfa's** early life and her journey to stardom.

Early Life and Mor Tham Kwan Nak
--------------------------------

**Engfa Waraha** or “Mook” was born on February 15, 1995, from Undon Thani Province in Thailand. She grew up in a household of musicians as her father played the keyboard and her mother was a country singer. Being in a music-centric family helped shape her as a singer. At the age of six, she performed her first singing contest.

After her father passed away, **Engfa** became a monk ceremonial doctor called _Mor Tham Kwan Nak_. This religious ritual involves performing ceremonies that are believed to bring good fortune to individuals and their families. _Kwan Nak_ refers to ceremonies that invite positive influences into one's life. As a _Mor Tham Kwan Nak_, **Engfa** became an expert in performing this ceremony.   

To pay off her father’s treatment, **Engfa** took many jobs including caddy, food vendor, and modelling and signed a 12-year contract with Sangravee Entertainment. Her determination to overcome adversity is part of the reason why many Thais respect and love her as a role model.    

### The Voice and Miss Grand Thailand

In 2018, Engfa performed on Season 7 of The Voice Thailand. She performed _Yak Jer Kon Jing Jai_ and passed the audition. Her performance was well-received and gained over 26 million views since 2018. Engfa made it to the knockout round but unfortunately, due to a contractual issue, Engfa had to withdraw from the competition.

In 2022, Engfa participated in Miss Grand Thailand and fans were impressed and loved her looks and singing voice. Not only this, Engfa was paired with Charlotte Austin, the 5th runner-up of Miss Grand Thailand 2022. Engfa and Charlotte would later star in a mini-series called _Show Me Love_. The series follows a couple named Meena played by Engfah and Cherene played by Chalotte. Their onscreen chemistry made many people excited for the relationship to develop off-camera.     

Engfa’s latest movie Paradise of Thornes, is a story about an unmarried homosexual couple. After one partner’s death, his family seized assets due to a lack of legal recognition for the couple. It follows Thongkam played by Jeff Satur, who fights to reclaim their shared property and life's work. The movie became a huge hit in Thailand for many casual audiences and members of the LGBTQ community alike. The film grossed over 100 million Thai Baht nationwide.

**Amazon Prime Video**'s latest offering **Love Stuck** marks the platform's first Thai original, bringing an exciting blend of fantasy, romance and comedy to audiences worldwide.

Adapted from the acclaimed film The Map Of Tiny Perfect Things (2021), an Amazon original that was nominated for a Critics' Choice Award for best movie made for television and received positive reviews from both critics and audiences, Love Stuck offers a fresh take on the time loop narrative, following the lives of two individuals trapped in the same day, over and over again.

Love Stuck features a stellar cast, led by Teeradon "James" Supapunpinyo, Plearnpichaya "June" Komalarajun and Thitiya "Baipor" Jirapornsilp, with supporting roles by Sanya "Doo" Kunakorn, Grace Mahadumrongkul and Monthapoom "Pide" Sumonvarangkul.

Love Stuck delves into themes of personal growth, family and the pursuit of happiness while weaving a captivating story full of charming moments. Teeradon Supapunpinyo, known for his dynamic roles in cinema, takes on the lead character, Toy, a mischievous yet endearing young man whose life comes to a standstill as he finds himself reliving Dec 31 repeatedly.

In a recent interview with Life, Teeradon shared his excitement about portraying Toy, a role that presented him with new experiences and challenges.

"First, it's a fresh role, and there aren't many Thai films that explore the time loop concept. Second, I was really drawn to the character," Teeradon said, emphasising the allure of stepping into a genre that isn't frequently explored in Thai cinema.

Toy's character is playful and optimistic, though slightly self-absorbed, which adds complexity to his journey. Teeradon found it both enjoyable and challenging to channel Toy's youthful exuberance.

"It's meant to have fun vibes. As we grow up, life is not that enjoyable and even a bit dark," he joked. The actor, who has taken on more serious roles in the past, found this comedic turn refreshing. "I've always wanted to star in a romcom, but no one has offered me a role until now. Unlike my work in Hormones \[2013\], which centres on high schoolers, the characters in this film are more mature since they are fresh graduates."

At the heart of Love Stuck is Toy's relationship with Vee, played by Plearnpichaya Komalarajun. A mysterious and captivating young woman, Vee shares Toy's peculiar predicament of being stuck in the time loop.

The two embark on a journey together, searching for moments of joy hidden in their ever-repeating day. Plearnpichaya brought her own flair to the role, drawing inspiration from the original film while making Vee her own.

"The director explained Vee's character to me. While some details were altered from the original version, it still gave me a rough picture of Vee, allowing me to put my own ideas into the role," Plearnpichaya explained.

Vee is not just a love interest -- she's an independent woman with a deep passion for physics and a fascination with the stars, which sets her apart from typical romantic comedy heroines. This blend of intellect and vulnerability makes her a captivating character who resonates with viewers.

"Vee has a strong sense of self; she's confident and knows her own standpoint. Although she may seem tough at times, Vee also has a softer side," Plearnpichaya shared, noting the layers to her character's personality.

However, the time loop isn't just a device for light-hearted comedy or romance -- it forces both characters to confront deeper issues. For Toy, the loop eventually leads him to uncover painful truths about his family, reshaping his outlook on life. Meanwhile, Vee faces her own emotional battles, which are key to understanding why they're both stuck in the loop in the first place. The film's balance of emotional depth and whimsical charm is part of what makes it so compelling.

Alongside Teeradon and Plearnpichaya, Thitiya Jirapornsilp plays Toy's younger sister, Rin, an aspiring saxophonist with dreams of earning a music scholarship. As the only girl in a male-dominated household, Rin serves as both a mediator and a pillar of strength for her family, particularly after the loss of their mother.

"Rin makes an effort to take care of everyone in the family and tries not to be a burden to her father and brother," Thitiya said. Her character adds a familial warmth to the story, providing balance to the romantic and fantastical elements.

One of the most challenging aspects for Thitiya in this role was learning to play the saxophone, an instrument she had never touched before.

"For me, playing the saxophone was both challenging and interesting since it was a new experience for me. I had to practise seriously to get the hang of it," she recalled, laughing at the difficulties of mastering the breathing techniques required for the instrument. Her dedication paid off, though, and her performances on screen bring Rin's musical aspirations to life in a convincing and heartfelt way.

The cast's chemistry is palpable, both in their romantic and familial dynamics, making the movie's emotional beats all the more resonant. Plearnpichaya fondly recalled one of her favourite scenes, a dance sequence with Teeradon.

"We both have dance backgrounds -- I was in a girl group and James was in a boy band. However, the choreography for this scene was unlike anything we'd done before, as it was a duet dance," she said, describing the trust and synchronisation required for the complex lifts and spins in the routine.

While the film's charm lies in its lightheartedness and romance, Love Stuck also manages to sneak in subtle, thought-provoking messages about life, family and the passage of time. Teeradon reflected on these deeper themes, noting that despite the film's fun tone, it has a lot to say about family connections.

"What makes it even more charming is that the movie doesn't dictate how to have fun; because in the end, the core of it is a family movie. I really appreciate the subtle messages it conveys."

For fans of fantasy, romance, or comedy, Love Stuck seems to be a movie with plenty to offer, combining laugh-out-loud moments with touching emotional beats. Teeradon's portrayal of Toy, Plearnpichaya's nuanced performance as Vee, and Thitiya's endearing turn as Rin come together to create a film that is as entertaining as it is heartwarming.

As the three stars of Love Stuck reflected on their experience working on the film, they also pondered what day they would choose to be stuck in, if given the chance. For Teeradon, the answer was simple: "I would choose my birthday... because it's a day when I can be with my friends. I enjoy drinking and socialising, so if I'm feeling bored, I can always invite them over for a fun time."

For Plearnpichaya, health and beauty were top of mind. "I would choose to be stuck on any day, as long as I'm healthy -- no sickness allowed! Most importantly, I want to have clear skin with no pimples."

And Thitiya, ever the style enthusiast, would relive a glamorous day at Bangkok Fashion Week: "It was a proud and impressive moment in my life -- a fantastic moment to see people in beautiful outfits and witness amazing fashion."

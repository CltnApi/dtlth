UOB Thailand has extended a **THB 1.5 billion sustainability-linked loan (SLL)** to Mitr Phol Sugar Corp Ltd, the world’s fourth-largest sugar producer, to support its working capital needs while advancing its sustainability agenda.

“This partnership underscores UOB’s commitment to fostering a sustainable future where social inclusiveness, environmental impact, and economic progress go hand in hand,” said Ms Panitsanee Tansavatdi, Head of Corporate Banking at UOB Thailand. 

Mitr Phol has been a recognised leader in sustainable practices, earning an impressive **ESG Score of 85** from S&P Global in 2023. The company scored top marks in the environmental and social categories, outperforming industry averages and showcasing its dedication to corporate responsibility. 

The SLL incentivises Mitr Phol to maintain and improve its **ESG performance**, with preferential financing terms tied to achieving pre-agreed sustainability targets. These targets align with the company’s roadmap for carbon neutrality by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050, pledged under the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). 

Mr Verajet Vongkusolkit, CEO of Mitr Phol Group’s Thai Sugar, Energy and New Business division, emphasised the importance of sustainable business practices that empower communities and ensure environmental stewardship. 

Founded in 1946, Mitr Phol has grown to produce approximately 4 million tonnes of sugar annually and holds an “A” credit rating with a stable outlook from TRIS Rating. The company’s diversification into renewable energy, bio-based products, and logistics further highlights its commitment to sustainable growth. 

With a strong focus on **social responsibility and innovation**, this collaboration between UOB and Mitr Phol sets a benchmark for sustainable financing in Thailand, contributing to the country's economic progress and environmental goals.

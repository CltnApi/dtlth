As Bangkok's sky sparkles with a display of eco-friendly fireworks, Lalisa 'Lisa' Manobal, the Kingdom's incredible singer and style icon, will be the headliner for the Amazing Thailand Countdown 2025 at Iconsiam, which will take place from Dec 29-31.

Under the concept "Iconic Celebration Of Thai-Global Phenomena", people will get a chance to experience Thailand's vibrant spirit and ring in New Year 2025 against a backdrop of the majestic Chao Phraya River. This three-day celebration aims to solidify Thailand's reputation as the world's top countdown destination.

"With a vision to elevate Thailand's global standing as the top countdown destination, Iconsiam is allocating a significant investment in this extraordinary event. To curate a 'World Captivating Phenomena', we invite Lisa, a world-renowned rapper, singer, dancer and style icon who has brought global fame to Thailand and inspired people worldwide, to perform on the most magnificent scenery of the Chao Phraya River, bringing joy to Thais and international visitors on countdown night," said Supoj Chaiwatsirikul, managing director of Iconsiam.

"The event aims to attract over 20 million guests both in person and through live broadcasts across the nation and worldwide. This will uplift the image for Thailand and stimulate the economy, especially the tourism sector."

Earlier this year, Lisa launched her own company, LLOUD, in an effort to provide a platform for showcasing her musical and entertainment vision. In partnership with RCA Records, she made a comeback in June with the release of her solo single Rockstar, which was produced by Ryan Tedder and Sam Homaee. The music video was shot in Yaowarat to highlight her homeland.

To broaden her musical horizons, she collaborated with Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Rosal√≠a for their single New Woman before her new song Moonlit Floor debuted at the Global Citizen Festival 2024 in September. She also added her own twist to the 90s hit song Kiss Me by Sixpence None The Richer.

In addition to her musical career, Lisa will also be starring in the third season of popular HBO Original series The White Lotus, which was filmed in Thailand.

The International Federation of Muaythai Associations (IFMA) has appointed former Football Association of Thailand (FAT) president Worawi Makudi as a member of its Advisory Council.

The IFMA said in a statement that Worawi's appointment reflects the association's continued commitment to advancing Muay Thai's prominence on the international stage, which further aligns with the values and goals of the Olympic Movement.

Worawi was general secretary of the FAT from 1996 to 2007 and then served as its president from 2007 to 2015.

He has also represented Asia on Fifa's executive committee for nearly 20 years, spearheading key initiatives and chairing significant committees within the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), including those for futsal, women's football and refereeing.

The IFMA statement added that Worawi has joined the world body "at a pivotal moment, as the organisation seeks to build on its legacy of excellence.

"Central to this vision is the development of a world Muay Thai league, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at professionalising the sport while celebrating its cultural roots."

IFMA president Dr Sakchye Tapsuwan, a former governor of the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT), emphasised the importance of strategic leadership in realising this ambitious goal.

"Khun Worawi Makudi's expertise and international stature bring invaluable strength to our mission of elevating Muaythai on the global stage," said Dr Sakchye.

The IFMA Advisory Council, chaired by His Highness Prince Nawaphansa Yugala and co-chaired by Khun Somsak Leeswadtrakul, plays a critical role in shaping the federation's future.

The leadership team also includes prominent figures such as HRH Prince Fahad bin Mansour bin Saad bin Saud bin Abdulaziz, Abdullah Saeed Amer Al Neyadi, and Somchart Charoenwacharawit.

The IFMA claims it is the sole Muay Thai organisation recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and compliant with World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) standards.

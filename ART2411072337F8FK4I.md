Charges due for 1st batch of iCon suspects

The Department of Special Investigation (DSI) is expediting its investigation into the first group of suspects involved in The iCon Group pyramid scheme, with its acting chief saying yesterday the process could be wrapped up as soon as today.

According to Pol Maj Yuthana Phraedam, the DSI plans to send the result of its investigation into the 18 suspects as soon as it wraps up so they can be charged before their 84-day detention period expires.

These suspects will also face additional charges under the Fraudulent Loan Act and Direct Sale and Marketing Act, Pol Maj Yuthana said.

He added that the second group of suspects will be charged as soon as the investigation into their role in the scheme wraps up.

When asked to comment on the 20 individuals who asked the DSI on Monday to be included as potential witnesses in the case, Pol Maj Yuthana said they should ask their attorneys to submit a formal request, listing out the names of witnesses and the nature of the information they have on the case.

He said the DSI has also instructed Witoon Kengngam, a lawyer who represented The iCon Group founder and CEO Warathaphon "Boss Paul" Waratyaworrakul, to provide a list of additional witnesses, with a clear explanation of each individual's involvement in the scheme.

The request followed Mr Witoon's earlier pledge to bring at least 2,000 witnesses for the probe.

He also threatened to report the department for malfeasance if it failed to question all of them.

Pol Maj Yuthana said investigators have seized 78 land plots across Greater Bangkok that are owned by the 18 suspects and their accomplices.

The DSI will transfer the assets to the Anti-Money Laundering Office (Amlo) for further investigation later, he added.

Witthaya Niti-tham, the Amlo spokesman, said the office had seized at least 320 million baht of assets from suspects so far, mostly cash held in savings accounts.

Amlo is now working on a stabilised asset list before working out the appropriate compensation for The iCon Group victims.

Assets that have been transferred to outsiders, such as charities, will be probed to determine whether they were transferred with good intentions, the spokesman added.

ZTE Corporation (0763.HK / 000063.SZ), a global leader in integrated information and communication technology solutions, took centre stage as the platinum sponsor at the W.Media Thailand Cloud & Datacenter Convention 2024. At the event, ZTE showcased its comprehensive intelligent computing solutions, including IDC full lifecycle services and innovative technologies. The company introduced a liquid cooling-based data centre solution designed to address key challenges and build efficient, scalable, and sustainable data centres. Additionally, ZTE unveiled a complete lineup of servers, storage, and cloud solutions tailored to both general and intelligent computing scenarios. This showcase reaffirmed ZTE's commitment to expanding its footprint in the Thai market and serving the region. 

The W.Media event, which fosters connections within Asia's cloud and data centre industry, provided an ideal platform for ZTE to highlight its cutting-edge data centre solutions, innovative models, and high-performance servers. ZTE's participation aligns with its strategy to strengthen its influence in Thailand's cloud and data centre market through emerging technologies and sustainable infrastructure. 

Today, next-generation communication technologies such as 5G, cloud computing, big data, AI, and VR/AR are transforming lifestyles and production models. The rapid growth of new industries is driving global expansion in the cloud and data centre sectors. As Thailand's IT industry enters a new phase, demand for servers continues to rise. ZTE offers stable and reliable end-to-end cloud solutions to support digital transformation across various application scenarios, including cloud computing, big data processing, distributed storage, and AI. 

With 20 years of experience in data centre turnkey projects, global delivery capabilities, and project management expertise, ZTE has established itself as a leader in the data centre industry. The company has developed a wide range of products, from container data centres to modular designs and advanced cooling solutions, supported by over 300 technical experts. Long-term strategic partnerships have enabled rapid deployment and seamless project execution. ZTE completed Asia's largest modular data centre in 2014 and pioneered fully modular prefabricated data centres in 2017, while leading large-scale edge-DC applications in 2020. 

ZTE's next-generation liquid-cooled IDC and power solutions significantly improve efficiency to meet future development demands.

Ultimate Energy Conservation: ZTE provides a comprehensive cold plate liquid cooling solution with a PUE as low as 1.1. It supports diverse climatic environments and can be applied to both new constructions and retrofits. The solution includes dual power supplies and pumps for increased reliability, comprehensive water quality monitoring (conductivity, pH levels, and corrosion rates), and stable operations. It also features ±0.5℃ high-precision constant temperature control, adaptive flow regulation based on load variations, and intelligent device operation assessments. A three-level leak-proof design ensures the safe operation of data centres. 

Efficient Power Distribution: ZTE's prefabricated power modules are optimised for medium to large data centres. By integrating high-density components, these modules reduce the physical footprint and simplify delivery through prefabrication, shortening construction timelines. The intelligent management system offers visualised monitoring and preventive maintenance, ensuring operational security. 

Guided by Intelligent Computing: Under the strategy "Unleash the Power of Intelligent Computing," ZTE has developed a full range of servers and storage solutions, including general-purpose servers, liquid-cooling servers, massive storage servers, all-flash storage, hybrid storage, and distributed storage. These solutions have been deployed across over 40 countries and regions, supporting industries such as communications, internet, finance, energy, government, and transportation.

**Comprehensive Portfolio and Scenarios:** ZTE offers high-performance training servers, cost-effective inference servers, integrated cabinets for out-of-the-box training and inference, general computing servers, high-performance file storage, and RoCE switches. These products support the development of intelligent computing centres from core to edge. 

**Optimal Price/Performance Ratio:** ZTE enables resource pooling, virtualisation, unified management, and scheduling of heterogeneous computing power, with dynamic adjustments to training and inference resources to maximise utilisation. 

**Open Ecosystem:** ZTE promotes software/hardware decoupling, training/inference decoupling, and model decoupling to build a fully open and decoupled intelligent computing ecosystem. 

**Green and Energy-Saving Solutions:** The new G6 series servers incorporate immersion cooling technology, using high-efficiency coolants to achieve better PUE. Innovations such as indium foil cooling and flow optimisation improve cooling efficiency by 20% and reduce energy consumption by 30%. The dust-free and vibration-free design lowers failure rates by 50%, offering a green, low-carbon solution while ensuring reliability. 

**TECS Cloud:** ZTE's cloud data centre solution leverages in-house developed virtualisation components and the OpenStack cloud management platform to build scalable cloud computing infrastructure. The iSware cloud platform, supporting active-active architectures, ensures business continuity by managing applications in active-active mode. 

Moving forward, ZTE will continue to explore the field of intelligent computing, deepen ecosystem cooperation, and refine application practices to accelerate the intelligent transformation of industries. ZTE's data centre and server solutions, characterised by efficiency, sustainability, intelligence, security, and reliability, are well-positioned to meet the evolving needs of businesses in Thailand. 

ZTE's participation in the W.Media Thailand Cloud & Datacenter Convention 2024 underscores its ambition to strengthen its presence in Thailand's data centre and server market.

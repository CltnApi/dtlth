Former Italy international Gianfranco Zola.

Gianfranco Zola, John Terry, Nemanja Vidic and Teddy Sheringham have confirmed their participation in the Reignwood Icons of Football in March next year.

The March 1-2 tournament will be held at Robinswood Golf Club in Pathum Thani.

Former Italy international and Chelsea legend Zola and ex-Manchester United captain Vidic will join Team World, led by Spanish golfer Sergio Garcia.

Former England and Chelsea captain Terry and ex-England and Manchester United striker Sheringham will play for Team England, skippered by Lee Westwood.

Zola and Vidic will team up with Dwight Yorke, Patrick Berger, Gabriel Batistuta, Luis Figo and Peter Schmeichel in Team World.

Terry and Sheringham will join the likes of Paul Ince, Robbie Fowler, Joe Hart, Theo Walcott and Paul Scholes in Team England.

The event is a collaboration between Reignwood Park and The Icons Series.

The Icon Series, which brings together the world's top athletes to compete in a golf tournament, has been held in many countries around the world such as the United States, the United Arab Emirates and England.

The event in Thailand will be the first in Southeast Asia.

The competition will be played in a match-play format between Team England and Team World, with 12 players on each team.

The remaining players of each team will be revealed later.

Ichitan x Mackcha: Inspiring Eco-Friendly Packaging Revolution

Did you know that only 10% of plastic is recycled, while the remaining 90% accumulates in landfills, harming the environment and exacerbating greenhouse gas emissions and climate change? To address this, Ichitan Group has launched a new product under the concept 'ReLife the Plastic, ReLife the Ocean'. This charming collaboration, Ichitan x Mackcha, features the limited-edition Chalotte collection on Ichitan Green Tea 500 ml. The packaging is made from 100% recyclable rPET (Recycled Plastic), including the bottle, cap, and label, and showcases Charlotte, the Girl of an Enchanting Underwater Kingdom, a character created by rising pop artist Mackcha, who shares a passion for environmental awareness and connects strongly with Generation Z. 

Tan Passakornnatee, CEO of Ichitan Group PCL, remarked: “We are seeing the consequences of neglecting our planet: storms, floods, and extreme heat. It’s a clear signal that urgent action is needed. Ichitan encourages everyone to consume responsibly and recycle as much as possible to reduce environmental strain. The Ichitan x Mackcha: Chalotte Collection bottles are designed to be entirely recyclable, from the bottle to the label and cap. Environmental responsibility cannot be achieved alone—it requires collective effort. We still have a chance to restore our planet, but we must act now.” 

This collaboration with Mackcha introduces 'Charlotte' and her whale companion as symbols of ocean protection, promoting responsible production and offering consumers a sustainable choice through the ‘ReLife the Plastic, ReLife the Ocean’ campaign. Ichitan’s commitment to sustainability also includes eco-friendly manufacturing processes such as Cold Aseptic Filling Technology, which reduces plastic use by 28.5%. The company aims for carbon neutrality in production by 2050 and plans to integrate at least 30% rPET in its 500 ml Green Tea products by 2024, cutting virgin plastic usage by 175 tons annually. 

Enjoy the rich taste of Green Tea while supporting the planet with the Ichitan x Mackcha: Chalotte Collection, available in three flavours: Honey Lemon, Original, and Ganmaicha, each priced at 25 baht. Encourage younger generations to make sustainable choices by returning plastic bottles for recycling and redeeming a limited-edition ‘Charlotte’ lanyard made from rPET, available exclusively at EM STATION 1, M Floor, Emporium, from 11 November to 8 December 2024.

Whoscall, a leading anti-scam application, and its creative partners, SOUR Bangkok and Dentsu Creative Thailand, triumphed at the AdPeople Awards and Symposium 2024, securing nine top awards for their innovative campaigns. The campaigns included the hit single ‘ตัดสาย’ (Hang Up) and the radio spot ‘เบอร์อัปมงคล’ (Unlucky Number), which combine music, technology, and entertainment to raise scam awareness and drive behavioural change across Thailand. 

Ms Titinun Suttinaraphan, Regional Marketing Director of Southeast Asia at Gogolook, the developer of Whoscall, expressed her pride in the campaigns' impact: "‘Hang Up’ and ‘Unlucky Number’ showcase how creativity, music, and collaboration can address the rise in telephone scams. These campaigns not only raise nationwide awareness but also encourage prevention by promoting behaviour changes, such as hanging up on unknown numbers and using Whoscall for protection. We are honoured to receive this recognition, which underscores our commitment to combating scams through innovation." 

The ‘Hang Up’ (TAD-SAI ตัดสาย) campaign, a collaboration with SOUR Bangkok and GMM MUSIC, featured popular artist Joey Phuwasit, delivering a compelling call-to-action: hang up on scammers. The music video highlighted common scams, such as police impersonation, romance scams, and fraudulent delivery schemes. The campaign won seven awards, including: 

*   1 Gold in Entertainment Music (Use of Original Composition) 
    

*   3 Silver in Craft and Entertainment 
    

*   2 Bronze in Entertainment Music and Radio & Audio 
    

*   The prestigious AdLegend Award, judged by Thailand’s advertising industry icons 
    

Meanwhile, the ‘เบอร์อัปมงคล (Unlucky Number)’ campaign, created with Dentsu Creative Thailand, reinterpreted the Thai belief in lucky numbers, framing scammers’ numbers as “unlucky” to alert users. This 30-second parody radio spot won a Silver and a Bronze Award in the Radio & Audio category. 

The AdPeople Awards & Symposium 2024, organised by the Advertising Association of Thailand (AAT), celebrated creativity under the theme “Creativity for Peoplekind”, emphasising the potential for all professions to inspire societal change.

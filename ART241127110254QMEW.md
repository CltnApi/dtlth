We are excited to announce [that LiteFinance](https://www.litefinance.org/?uid=880952068&cid=267831&utm_source=prnews&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=prnews) has entered into a multi-year partnership with Premier League football club Leicester City as their Official Trading Partner. This collaboration marks a significant milestone for LiteFinance as we expand our presence in the world of sports, aligning our brand with one of England’s most admired football clubs. 

**«Leicester City Football Club is pleased to [confirm LiteFinance](https://www.lcfc.com/news/4088035/leicester-city-confirm-litefinance-as-official-trading-partner?lang=en) as its new Official Trading Partner.»**

Established in 2005, LiteFinance has grown into a leading online broker, offering high-speed trading services in 29 international languages.

Through this partnership, we aim to bring our innovative, accessible trading solutions to a broader audience, enhancing the experience for both our clients and Leicester City’s global fanbase.

**Shared Values and Vision**

Both LiteFinance and Leicester City share a commitment to excellence, innovation, and a global outlook. The Foxes have a significant following, particularly in Southeast Asia, where they enjoy one of the largest social media reaches outside of the Premier League’s traditional top six clubs. This partnership will allow LiteFinance to engage with new audiences and create memorable experiences for football fans and our clients alike.

**Visibility and Engagement**

As part of this partnership, LiteFinance will benefit from extensive brand visibility, including pitch-facing LED advertising, logo placements on interview backdrops, and a selection of digital advertising.

Additionally, our clients will have exclusive access to branded promotional materials, such as custom merchandise, and will be able to participate in special contests and promotions designed to bring excitement and memorable experiences to football fans. These initiatives are tailored to enhance engagement and connect meaningfully with Leicester City supporters.

**Statements from Leadership**

Kristina Leonova, CEO of LiteFinance, commented: «We are thrilled to embark on this exciting journey with Leicester City. This partnership reflects our mutual commitment to excellence and innovation. It will allow us to connect with new audiences and create impactful experiences while delivering on our promises and setting new standards of success.»

The bodies of four Thai workers killed by rocket fire in northern Israel on Oct 31 will arrive at Suvarnabhumi airport in Samut Prakan province on Friday afternoon.

The Thai Ambassador to Israel, Pannabha Chandraramya, led embassy officials and representatives of the Thai workers to attend a ceremony at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv at 5.45pm (local time) on Wednesday to repatriate the bodies of the four male workers - Akkhaphol Wannasai, Prayad Pilasram, Thana Tichantuek and Kaweesak Papanang - to Thailand. Â 

Representatives of Israel also attended the ceremony. They expressed condolences on behalf of the Israel authorities to the families of the four workers and promised to care for Thais working in Israel with the same standards as their own citizens.

Ms Pannabha laid wreaths to pay respects to the bodies of the workers, and all participants stood to mourn the deceased.

The four agricultural workers were killed, and one was injured by [rocket fire near Metula](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2894226/four-thai-nationals-killed-near-israel-lebanon-border-says-thai-foreign-affairs-minister), Israel's northernmost town bordering Lebanon, on Oct 31.

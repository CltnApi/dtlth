On Friday, November 8, 2024, at Wat Fangmin, Mueang Chiang Rai District, Chiang Rai Province, Prasert Jitpleecheep, Vice-Governor of Chiang Rai, and  Nopadol Ramyarupa led a similar donation ceremony.

The donations aim to support flood victims by repairing homes and buildings damaged in the recent floods. Representatives from the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Offices of both provinces, local government officials, residents, media, and other attendees witnessed the events.

As part of the “Strong Cement, Doing Good Deed with a Strong Heart” initiative, 64 tons (1,360 bags) of Dokbua Cement were donated to flood victims in Phayao Province on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at Wat Si Khomkham in Mueang Phayao District.

Rattapol stated:“The recent floods in Phayao caused significant loss and damage, severely impacting livelihoods. Urgent restoration efforts are required to address:

Damage to life and property: Many have lost homes, belongings, and critical institutions such as temples, schools, and government offices.

Agriculture: Crops were destroyed, leaving farmers without income.

Infrastructure: Roads, bridges, and utilities were heavily damaged.

Economic impact: The disruption of activities has hurt the local economy.

Asia Cement, as the producer of Dokbua Brand cement, recognizes these hardships and has provided 64 tons (1,360 bags) of cement to aid in recovery efforts.”

He added that 12 temples and 24 schools in Phayao received cement, with volunteer craftsmen repairing damage to three schools.

Prasert Jitpleecheep stated: “The devastating 2024 floods in Chiang Rai brought immense loss—separating families, destroying homes and communities, and damaging agriculture and public infrastructure across vast areas. Amid this crisis, we witnessed nationwide support.

Asia Cement, alongside its partners, has provided 49 tons (1,060 bags) of cement under the ‘Strong Cement, Doing Good Deed with a Strong Heart’ initiative to sustainably restore livelihoods. This donation will be used to repair temples, schools, and public utilities through the Chiang Rai Provincial Administrative Organization. On behalf of Chiang Rai, I extend heartfelt thanks to Asia Cement and all involved for their generosity, helping the people of Chiang Rai smile again.”

He noted that eight temples and six schools received the donated cement.

Nopadol remarked: “Recognizing the severity of these floods, Asia Cement launched the ‘Strong Cement, Doing Good Deed with a Strong Heart’ CSR initiative to renovate and repair damaged homes and buildings in northern Thailand. Earlier, we donated 15 tons of cement via the Ejan Page to support flood recovery in Mae Sai and Mueang Chiang Rai. This was followed by 64 tons for Phayao and 49 tons for Chiang Rai.

The donated Dokbua Brand cement is environmentally friendly, GO GREEN, low-carbon cement that minimizes CO2 emissions at every production stage, aligning with our commitment to sustainable development.”

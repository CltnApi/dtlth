His breakthrough role came in 2019 as Doctor Tao, a supporting character in the drama series _**My Ambulance**_, starring **Davika Hoorne** and **Sunny Suwanmethanont**. This catapulted him into popularity, leading to his first lead role in _**I Told Sunset About You**_, where he starred alongside **Krit Amnuaydechkorn**, known as **PP Krit**. The film explores the relationship of two teenage boys as they come to terms with their identity, sexuality, and love.

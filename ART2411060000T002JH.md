PM 'won't meddle' in Thaksin probe

Tawee: Says no law was broken

Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra gave assurances yesterday that she would not interfere in an ongoing probe into claims that her father, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was given privileged treatment during his detention at the Police General Hospital (PGH).

Ms Paetongtarn said the government would follow regulations and cooperate with agencies conducting the investigation when asked about the National Anti-Corruption Commission's (NACC) request for records of Thaksin's medical treatment.

However, the prime minister said she is unsure whether or how much such information can be disclosed based on the data privacy-related laws.

Ms Paetongtarn was responding to questions about a possible conflict of interest due to her status as Thaksin's daughter and prime minister who oversees the Royal Thai Police (RTP).

She said she did not intervene in the matter or discuss the investigation with the national police chief. She added that the issue would not hurt the government's image if it cooperated in the probe.

Justice Minister Tawee Sodsong said yesterday that the relevant authorities would clarify details and provide information about Thaksin's medical records to the anti-graft agency.

He said the ministry adhered to the law, adding that relevant agencies could also request information regarding who visited Thaksin during his PGH detention.

Meanwhile, Seri Ruam Thai Party leader Pol Gen Sereepisuth Temeeyaves, who claimed he was among visitors who called on Thaksin during his detention, has declined the invitation for him to speak to the House committee on state security, border affairs, and national strategy tomorrow about his visit.

He said there was no need for him to meet the House panel as the matter was being investigated by the NACC, and he had already supplied information and evidence to the anti-graft agency.

Pol Gen Sereepisuth added that some committee members are associated with the ruling Pheu Thai Party, and he is concerned about information leaks.

He said the NACC can request Thaksin's medical records from the prime minister and Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, who oversees the RTP, and take action against the pair if they do not comply.

"The medical records are part of the evidence. There are other pieces of information that are useful to the investigation," he said.

The committee's move followed a report by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), which raised concerns about preferential treatment for inmates, specifically Thaksin.

In a landmark development for Thailand’s education sector, Brighton College Bangkok will extend its acclaimed British curriculum to a new Vibhavadi branch in 2025. This expansion reinforces the Assakul family’s vision of providing world-class education within the country, led by Nusara (Assakul) Banyatpiyaphod, Chair of The Brighton College Bangkok Board. A commitment to fostering well-rounded anchors the school’s focus on academic excellence and culturally aware students who excel in Thai and international contexts.

Since introducing British curriculum education to Thailand in 1998 at St. Stephen’s International School, investor, and parent Kris Assakul has recognised the value of an academically rigorous, globally relevant education. The new Vibhavadi campus reflects this heritage while continuing Brighton College Bangkok’s tradition of educational excellence. The Krungthep Kreetha campus, established in partnership with Brighton College UK, has consistently been recognised, most recently winning the “International School of the Year” award in 2024 and becoming the only school in Thailand to receive three consecutive shortlisting for the British International School of the Year award.

“Our curriculum is designed to inspire curiosity, build confidence, and encourage kindness in our students,” says Nusara, highlighting the school’s strategy for holistic development. The curriculum integrates academic rigour with extracurricular sports, performing arts, and public speaking opportunities, fostering essential life skills and encouraging students to explore their passions.

Academic success remains at the heart of Brighton College’s philosophy. The British curriculum promotes analytical thinking through in-depth subject discussions and interactive learning. In addition to core subjects, students benefit from an integrated approach to humanities – blending history, geography, and literature – designed to sharpen analytical skills and bridge their learning with real-world contexts. Mandarin language studies are also incorporated from the early years, equipping students with additional global language skills.

Brighton College Bangkok’s academic accomplishments are impressive: in 2023, 80% of A-Level students achieved A\*-A grades, with 47% securing A\*s, paving the way for top university admissions in the UK, Ivy League schools, and prestigious Thai institutions. The Sixth Form offers a broad range of 21 A-level subjects, empowering students to pursue a tailored path to their desired future.

“We endorse confidence through academic strengths, rooted in respect for Thai and British cultures,” adds Richard Cairns, Headmaster of the Brighton College Group. “Our students are taught to value traditions, etiquette, and the enduring connection between history and the present world.”

A critical element of Brighton College’s success is its faculty, who bring a wealth of expertise in fields such as mathematics, history, and science. These educators inspire students through creative teaching methods that connect academic theory to practical, real-world applications. “We believe in nurturing individual strengths and unique talents,” says Nusara. “Acknowledging the diversity in backgrounds and abilities helps each child discover the best version of themselves.”

Supported by a 1.4 billion baht investment, the Vibhavadi branch will feature cutting-edge facilities, including dedicated centres for the arts, STEM, and sports, creating an enriching environment for students from Early Years through IGCSE and A-Level. With a prime location for convenient access throughout Bangkok, the new campus aims to be a beacon of academic and personal growth.

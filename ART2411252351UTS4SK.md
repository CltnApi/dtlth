On Nov 17, a group of individuals with a shared passion for history and culture gathered at the wonderful Fazal Building in Bangkok for the exclusive opening of "New Century - The E.M. Katib Legacy".

Among the honourable guests were Indian ambassador Nagesh Singh and his spouse, Mexican ambassador Liliana Ferrer and former ambassador Pradap Pibulsongkram. This invitation-only event paid tribute to the Katib family, former owners of the building, by showcasing a collection of historical artefacts.

Located on the corner of Bamrung Mueang and Atsadang roads, the Fazal Building was constructed in the 1930s by an Italian architectural firm during King Rama VII's reign.

The building features both classic European style elements and local design. The ground floor of the building once housed the renowned E.M. Katib department store, known for its luxury goods such as fine-cut glassware, ceramic cups, perfume and fine porcelain imported from Europe. The royal family granted the store privileged access to procure exclusive European items on their behalf, including glassware and ceramics.

The exhibition "New Century - The E.M Katib Legacy" was organised by Fazal Unlimited, created by three co-founders -- Pataraphand Chirathivat, Pierre Béchon and Issiree Shereen Sarntisart.

With his passion for history and culture, Pataraphand was deeply impressed by the historical significance of the Fazal Building. He shared his impression with his father Prof Suthiphand Chirathivat and successfully persuaded him to invest in the preservation of the Fazal Building in 2016. Under their management, the property underwent renovation from 2018 to 2020 to maintain its original condition as much as possible.

The exhibition displays a collection of historical artefacts loaned by Morakot Katib, Kanissorn Katib and Assoc Prof Adisra Katib -- descendants of E.M. Katib. Through the artefacts, viewers can time travel to when the Fazal Building was still the E.M. Katib department store.

Pierre Béchon explained that the idea for the exhibition came naturally after Pataraphand introduced his co-founders to Assoc Prof Adisra.

"The building has a history and we have a vision. The first goal was to connect and how we did that is by collaborating with the previous building owner and getting to know a bit more about what was happening here," said Béchon.

"Luckily, the Katib family still has objects that were sold when the building was still a department store and these objects are on display at the exhibition. We wanted to, as both a courtesy and a commemoration, celebrate the past while embracing the future."

"We celebrated the past by showing what happened here and by inviting the previous owner and discussing the building. Moreover, we showed them what we wanted to do."

The main exhibition is a collection of crystals displayed on the 3rd floor by Baccarat, one of the oldest French crystal manufacturer.

"The set on display on the 3rd floor was launched around 1916. It was a collection produced by Baccarat for a bathroom and cosmetics. The red set was a gift from an elder in the Katib family to Assoc Prof Adisra and the blue set belongs to Kanissorn Katib," said Issiree.

"A complete set would have nearly 20 pieces but it is extremely rare to find someone who has a full set. Therefore, we photographed the collection for our archives. In addition to the red and blue sets, a white set was added to the display to reflect the colours of the French and Thai flags. Personally, we find these sets to be the most impactful."

As E.M. Katib was a department store of luxury goods, the 2nd floor showcases invaluable artefacts imported from other countries. Additionally, visitors have the opportunity to admire seals from King Rama V and the E.M. Katib department store.

"The 2nd floor shows luxury pieces from different countries such as Belgium and Japan, and also porcelain from England. The exhibition represents the best in terms of luxury goods which were a must-have at that time," explained Béchon.

The exhibition has received positive feedback from visitors. Pataraphand revealed that visitors, especially foreign ambassadors, appreciated their effort to preserve the building as a legacy for future generations.

Although the co-founders of Fazal Unlimited share the same interests in culture, history and art, they established the company for business as well.

"In term of business, we sell objects that resonate with history. Right now, we live in a fast generation. Everything is extremely fast and items lose their importance. This building offers a bit of a pause in time because it has been here for almost 100 years. Everything we bring into this building has a connection to time," explained Béchon.

"This is a business with a certain level of exclusivity in terms of clients and the objects we work with. Not everything can be disclosed publicly. We work with people who trust us to find a new home for their artefacts and not everyone is willing to share details. Sometimes, the approach must balance inclusivity and exclusivity," said Béchon.

Pataraphand emphasised that Fazal Unlimited will focus on the history behind artefacts.

"Our research process involves a deep dive into the history of artefacts. We commit to narrating stories behind artefacts to ensure history won't fade. I saw some places that sell antique artifacts provide only the age and origin of their items. However, Fazal Unlimited believes that the story behind each piece is essential. We intend to uncover the unique stories that objects hold," he said.

As this exhibition is private, people who are interested must make an appointment in advance via email at contact@fazalunlimited.com.

Issiree explained that the reason for making the exhibition private is because previously people disrespected projects at their gallery, Tars Unlimited, on Song Wat Road.

"We want an audience that is interested in the exhibition. At 'Tars Unlimited', some people only see artwork as a background for Instagram photos. Many lack respect for the space or the artwork itself. Some people left behind drinks or leaned against the artwork. Some even used our space for pre-wedding photos or fashion photoshoots. We learned from these experiences and took steps to prevent such incidents from happening again," she said.

When asked about their next project, Issiree responded that it is still under discussion.

"During the grand opening, our guests were primarily families, friends and acquaintances. This provided us an opportunity to identify potential people who are interested in collaborating with us. However, the discussion is still ongoing. Additionally, the format of the event may not be limited to just an exhibition. It may be a one-night event or another format but our focus will still be on history and culture," she said.

"New Century - The E.M. Katib Legacy" runs privately at Fazal Building. The final day of the exhibition has not been set yet. To view the exhibition, you need to make an appointment in advance via email at contact@fazalunlimited.com. The email should include your full name and contact information and be sent at least one day before your planned visit.

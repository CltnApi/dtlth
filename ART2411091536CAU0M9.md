Rodtang ‘almost started another fight’ with Takeru, apologises for ONE Championship weight miss

Rodtang Jitmuangnon put his ONE Championship weight miss behind him with a crowd-pleasing exhibition on Saturday that set up a long-awaited showdown with Takeru Segawa.

The Japanese kickboxing icon ran into the ring after “The Iron Man” had eased to a unanimous decision win at ONE 169 against Jacob Smith, who was still eligible to win the now vacant flyweight Muay Thai title.

They butted heads before Takeru – who had watched the fight from ringside – quickly departed, suggesting their long-awaited fight will finally take place early next year.

“I want to face Takeru,” Rodtang told the Bangkok Post backstage at Lumpinee Stadium during the post fight press conference.

“Yes, I almost started another match right there in the ring, and I think that it is time now that I have to face Takeru. 

“I think this is the fight everybody is expecting, and hopefully Khun Chatri \[Sityodtong\] will give me this fight soon.”

Takeru told the Bangkok Post in the hallways of Lumpinee Stadium he is confident of victory – and another knockout – after registering his first finish in ONE in September.

The pair had enjoyed a staredown in the ring then, too, after Takeru climbed off the canvas to defeat Myanmar’s Thant Zin at ONE Friday Fights 81 in the same stadium.

The eagerly awaited matchup was all but assured, so long as Thailand’s Rodtang did not lose or suffer an injury against Britain’s Smith.

Doubts had been raised over his potential mindset going into Saturday’s clash, however, having been left in tears at Thursday’s weigh-ins. 

“I feel sad that I lost the belt on the scale. But I will continue, and get that belt back, and return to my throne soon,” Rodtang said.

The blunder had drawn fierce criticism from fans on social media, but the 27-year-old turned on the charm during a dominant display against Smith, to start winning some of them back over, at least.

After a hug from his mother on his way to the ring, Rodtang went through his whole repertoire of tricks – smiling and dancing, dropping his hands and goading Smith to take his best shot, and even kissing referee Olivier Coste on the cheek after being admonished for an infraction.

The crowd happily lapped it up, giving their hero the biggest cheers of the morning.

“I must say that I love this profession and I want to show everybody I have so many sides – not only being aggressive,” Rodtang added. “I can also smile. I want to show my other side of me, that I can still entertain all of you.”

Rodtang even accepted the local media’s criticism, telling the gathered reporters he was “not mad”.

“All of you want to say things about me. I must admit that I made a mistake,” he said. “But trust me – I won’t keep making mistakes all my life. 

“I will improve myself and adapt, and one day I will come back to flyweight, hopefully.”

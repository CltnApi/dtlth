Mars Unveils Chiang Mai Dog Park for Sustainability

Mars Incorporated, a global leader in pet care products and services, confectionery, snacking, and food, and the maker of some of the world’s most-loved brands, proudly concludes its SWAP Year 4 campaign in partnership with Chiang Mai’s local government by inaugurating a new dog park equipped with sustainable, pet-friendly amenities in Chiang Mai.  

Through the SWAP Year 4 campaign, which encourages pet parents to return empty packages of pet food from Mars Petcare's brands such as PEDIGREE®, WHISKAS®, IAMS™, CESAR®, SHEBA®, or TEMPTATIONS™, including plant-based litter for cats under the CATSAN™ label for recycling, participants had the chance to win prizes in a series of lucky draws, valued at over 2.4 million baht. Over 840,000 bags were collected, recycled, and transformed into practical and environmentally friendly products. This includes bone-shaped benches, and cat- and paw-shaped blocks, that now decorate the dog park, creating an inviting space for pets and their parents to enjoy quality time outdoors.  

The initiative also featured the installation of dog agility equipment, additional pet-friendly amenities, and responsible pet ownership signage, all of which reinforce Mars Pet Nutrition’s commitment to fostering greener, pet-friendly communities for quality outdoor experiences with pets through its Better Cities for Pets program. The new dog park offers an ideal space for pet parents and their furry companions to connect in a natural, open environment. In collaboration with Chiang Mai’s Provincial Administrative Organization (PAO), which graciously provided access to the area and facilitated the renovation process, Mars Pet Nutrition is proud to bring its purpose of creating a better world for pets to life. 

**Mr. Ratchakorn Chenpattanapong, General Manager for Mars Pet Nutrition Thailand and Indochina****,** expressed his enthusiasm for the project: “At Mars, we are committed to sustainability with a strong vision for a future in which no plastic packaging becomes waste but is recycled, reused or composted. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the pet parents who participated in our four-month SWAP Year 4 campaign, contributing approximately 850,000 bags. This year, we’re excited to expand the scope of our SWAP handover program beyond Bangkok to Chiang Mai, the largest city in northern Thailand. We look forward to seeing pet parents and their beloved pets in Chiang Mai enjoy this green space, enhanced with upcycled products from our campaign.” 

**Mr. Pichai Lertpongadisorn, President of Chiang Mai Provincial Administrative Organization (PAO),** said “We are proud to partner with Mars Pet Nutrition Thailand in transforming this space into a dedicated dog park for our dog-lover community. From the beginning, Mars has shared our vision of creating a welcoming, eco-friendly area for pets and their pet parents to enjoy. By dedicating part of our park for this purpose, we are enhancing the quality of life for both our residents and their pets, setting an example of sustainable community development here in Chiang Mai.” 

The launch of this new dog park marks a significant milestone in Mars ’s ongoing commitment to sustainability, responsible pet ownership, and community engagement. Mars continues to inspire and lead the way in creating healthier, more sustainable environments for pets and their pet parents.

Billed as the largest fitness showdown in the region, the **UA Combine 2024** featured eight standardized tests adopted from the **United States**: Agility, Stamina, Vertical (Jump), Power, Endurance, Strength, Speed, and Cognition. The event was contested in 32 nonstop batches, each lasting about an hour, with participants pushing their bodies to the brink to secure the title of champion.

The top-performing team claimed a cash prize of 50,000 Baht, while the individual male and female winners each walked away with 125,000 Baht.

The male overall champion title went to local star **Pusit Songjaroen**, who scored an impressive 3,506 points, edging out runner-up Daniel Gardiner with 3,481 points. On the women’s side, **Kunthida Thabthimhin** finally claimed victory with 2,740 points, overcoming last year’s heartbreak. Defending champion **Phorntida Chulopas** took second place, tallying 2,710 points.

“As an athlete, I’m accustomed to these tests, which are incredibly beneficial for assessing physical condition ahead of a competition. However, the general public can also gain from this event, as these challenges serve as an excellent way to enhance overall physical health,” said Superbon who won two **ONE Friday Fights** titles this year.

On the celebrity front, names such as actress and formal national junior diver **Nicha** “**Wawwa**” **Chokprajakchat**, **Matthew Dean**, and **Pattrakorn** “**Ply**” **Tungsupakul** added star power, as they too joined the action-packed competition.

Actress Wawwa shared, "The beauty standards for women have shifted from being skinny to embracing physical fitness. Beyond keeping us in shape and looking great, this competition helps us build strength and supports a healthier, longer life."

**Thepparit  Riwin**, Senior Marketing Manager at **UA Sports Thailand**, was thrilled by the event's success. “The incredible response showed how much people love testing their limits,” he said.  “This event is more than just a competition—it’s about personal growth.

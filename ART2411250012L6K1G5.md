The best of Bangkok Noi district is presented during the 6th Siriraj@Bangkok Noi Festival, which kicks off today and runs daily from 7am to 7pm, until Friday, at Bimuksthan Park and many areas within the Faculty of Medicine at Siriraj Hospital, Arun Amarin Road.

The festival is organised under the theme "Chatchan Nai Yan Ni" (meaning the most vibrant in the community) by the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, with the aim to bring happiness to medical personnel and promote outstanding products of Bangkok Noi district.

The event is divided into four themed zones. The "Happy Zone" at Bimuksthan Park presents daily concerts by famous artists including Getsunova, Scarlett, Bell Warisara, Ingrid The Voice and Pure The Voice. Expect to see music performances by students and medical students and a chorus directed by a professor emerita.

Exhibited are a variety of community products, namely Baan Bu bronze bowls and stainless steel, Benjarong porcelain handicrafts, ceramic works, hand-painted hemp fabric, candied bael fruit, crispy fried rice flakes, herbal oil and Otop products. Fun games are available with prizes to take home.

The "Fun Zone" presents a photo exhibition by medical students who portray the history, culture and livelihood of Bangkok Noi through various dimensions, at the lawn of the royal statue of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej.

Over 100 local shops are offering their products and foods at the "Delicious Zone" which spans across four venues -- Prince of Chai Nat Memorial Building, Vibulluk Building, Administration Building, and 100th Year Somdech Phrasrinagarindra Building.

Also, learn about waste sorting and management as well as wastewater treatment in an exhibition at the "Good Zone" located at the hall of 100th Year Somdech Phrasrinagarindra Building.

Visitors are encouraged to dress in vibrant colours. There is no admission fee.

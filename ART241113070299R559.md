GET Venture has announced an ambitious growth trajectory for 2024, with Chief Executive Officer Mr. Natt Kasemakrakvipas sharing optimistic insights. This year is set to be transformative for GET Venture, as the firm aims to achieve a 300 million THB investment portfolio in 2024, with a target of reaching 750 million THB by 2025.

GET Venture was founded with the mission of delivering consistent returns despite market volatility. The company prides itself on providing predictable income streams, instilling stability, and delivering attractive returns. In an era of significant market fluctuations, GET’s business model stands out for its commitment to transparency and reliability.

**Breaking Barriers to Support Thai Small Business with Private Capital**

Traditionally, private capital investments have only been accessible to large institutions, leaving a wider audience unable to take advantage of these exclusive opportunities. GET Venture seeks to change this narrative by acting as a bridge between Thai small businesses and the private capital market.

Mr. Kasemakrakvipas emphasises, “Our goal is to empower everyday SMEs. We understand that many wish to grow their business and secure funding for future expansion. As a new parent myself, I want to see my business grow to provide my children and grandchildren with the means to pursue their dreams.” GET Venture is committed to supporting Thai SME family businesses.

**Understanding the Private Market Landscape**

The potential for growth in private markets is significant, particularly as demand for capital escalates and attractive returns become increasingly available. Here, GET can help identify attractive investment opportunities to ensure sustainable returns for its shareholders.

Many of today’s successful unicorn startups, such as Grab and Shopee, began their journey through private equity funding. This underscores the importance and potential of private market investments in nurturing innovative companies.

Moreover, GET Venture recognises the dual opportunities in private financing—equity and debt. The company excels in the private debt market, where businesses seek funding for short- to medium-term needs to fuel growth and sustain operations. With a robust framework in place, GET Venture is well-positioned to cater to the evolving needs of businesses seeking liquidity and investors looking for solid returns.

**A Promising Future Ahead**

With ambitions for continued growth, GET Venture has set a target of a 750 million THB investment portfolio in the coming year. This goal reflects both confidence in the market and a commitment to expanding accessibility to investment opportunities.

GET’s innovative approach, combined with its mission to empower small businesses, marks a promising development for the financial landscape. As the firm continues to open doors to private market investments, it is not just about financial returns—it is about building a legacy and ensuring that families can navigate their financial futures with confidence.

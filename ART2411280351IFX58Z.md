Mill Hill International School Thailand is set to become a beacon of educational excellence in Chiang Mai, offering parents a unique option for their children's international education. As the first British international school in the area, it integrates the globally recognized UK curriculum with the rich cultural context of Thailand, aiming to develop well-rounded students who can thrive in a rapidly changing world.

**Curriculum and Educational Philosophy**

The school will be led by Mrs. Kate Simon, currently the Head of Grimsdell School and Mill Hill Pre-Preparatory School in the UK. She emphasizes the global reputation of the British curriculum, which balances academic rigor with essential life skills. The curriculum includes IGCSE and A-Level qualifications, known for their high standards and ability to foster creativity, adaptability, and critical thinking. This holistic approach prepares students not only for higher education but also for successful careers in an international environment.

Mill Hill Education Group, a prestigious educational group from the United Kingdom, has partnered with Mill Hill International School Thailand, operated under Ornsirin Holding Public Company Limited, a prominent real estate developer in Northern Thailand. This collaboration ensures that the school’s curriculum aligns closely with the rigorous academic standards of its UK counterpart. The partnership places a strong emphasis on academic excellence while fostering individual talents and cultivating a sense of responsible global citizenship among students.

**Admission Process**

The school adopts a selective admissions process tailored to each child's developmental stage:

Ages 3-5: Focus on physical, emotional, and foundational communication skills; prior English knowledge is not required.

Ages 6-10: Assessment of basic English and mathematics skills, along with analytical and social abilities such as teamwork.

**A Unique Educational Experience**

Dr. Yuthachai Damrongmanee, School Director of Mill Hill International School Thailand, highlighted the institution’s distinctive integration of a global curriculum with Thai cultural values. This innovative educational approach emphasizes holistic learning, with all lessons delivered by native English-speaking educators rigorously selected to meet the high standards of the UK education system.

To further cultivate students' potential, the school provides a wide range of co-curricular activities, fostering social responsibility and promoting mental well-being. The curriculum incorporates advanced technologies, including digital learning tools, artificial intelligence (AI), and blended learning methodologies, ensuring students have the flexibility to learn anytime, anywhere. The campus, characterized by its modern and spacious design, prioritizes student safety and is strategically located near major transport routes in Chiang Mai.

Graduates of Mill Hill International School Thailand are awarded IGCSE qualifications, with the option to advance to A-level courses. These programs are tailored to prepare students for higher education or vocational pathways, enabling them to pursue their academic and professional aspirations effectively.

**Future Developments**

Ms. Kanyanuk Rattanasatchan, the school's Business Manager, announced that construction is expected to be completed by December 2024, with classes commencing in September 2025. The first phase will accommodate approximately 150-160 students from Nursery to Year 6.

To engage parents and the community, the school will host open houses and curriculum presentations in October 2024. Despite being under construction, Mill Hill International School has already attracted significant interest from local and international families.

Recognising Thailand’s rapidly growing elderly population, CloudNurse has launched the nation’s first comprehensive digital platform tailored for senior care facilities. The platform integrates electronic health records (EHR) and management tools to streamline operations, reduce paperwork, and ultimately enhance the quality of care. Designed with ease of use and accessibility in mind, CloudNurse aims to set a new standard for elder care management in Thailand and beyond.

**Addressing an Urgent Demand in Aged Care**

With an aging population now comprising 20% of the nation—totalling over 13.2 million seniors—Thailand faces an accelerating need for high-quality elder care. More than one million seniors require daily support, while the demand for nursing homes continues to grow by 7.8% annually, outpacing rates in countries such as the United States and Japan. Despite this, many of the country’s 3,000 care facilities still rely on manual processes, which can create operational bottlenecks and impact service quality. (Reference: Mcknight Senior Living, 2023)

“CloudNurse was developed to transform Thailand’s senior care facilities by reducing administrative overhead and enabling caregivers to focus on what matters most—resident well-being,” said Thanasak Hoontrakul, Co-Founder and CEO of CloudNurse. “Our mission is to bring a new level of efficiency and compassion to elder care services through the integration of advanced technology.”

CloudNurse introduces an innovative suite of features specifically designed to address the unique demands of elder care facilities, including:

*   Electronic Medication Administration Record (eMAR): Facilitates secure medication management, reducing the risk of administration errors.
*   Incident Reporting: Provides tools for quick incident assessment and resolution, enabling facilities to maintain high standards of care.
*   Data Dashboard: Offers insight into facility operations, helping administrators make informed decisions that promote business growth.
*   AI-Generated Family Reports: Keeps families informed by automatically generating care summaries, supporting transparency and peace of mind, and freeing up caregivers to focus on patient needs.

**Broad Accessibility for All Users**

As a progressive web application (PWA), CloudNurse is compatible with iOS, Windows, Android, and all major browsers. This device-agnostic approach ensures that caregivers, facility managers, and family members can access vital information whenever and wherever they need it. “CloudNurse was built to provide seamless access across devices,” added Charlie Phairojmahakij, Co-Founder and CTO, “empowering everyone involved in a resident’s care to stay connected and informed.”

**Early Adoption and Expansion Goals**

CloudNurse is already in discussions with over 20 elder care facilities across Thailand and plans to grow to 100 facilities by 2025. “Our platform empowers caregivers, ensuring that time spent with residents is prioritised over paperwork. The positive impact on both caregivers and residents is our driving goal,” Mr. Thanasak noted.

**Limited-Time Offer**

Kelantan state opposite Narathiwat province will propose the government to build a 100-kilometre-long wall in a new move to crack down on cross-border crimes and smuggling.

Deputy Chief Minister Mohamed Fadzli Hassan has said the local government would seek approval from Kuala Lumpur for the wall which could also serve as a barrier to prevent flooding, according to the Bernama news agency.

"If the security forces want to guard the entire border, it is difficult to do so because the Malaysia-Thailand border is very vast. We will bring this proposal to build the wall to the federal government," he was quoted as saying on Tuesday.

The move is in line with the idea of the state police chief who recently mooted the plan to the local government.

Kelantan state and Narathiwat province share the 100 kilometre long water boundary with the Kolok River separating them.

Malaysian security authorities have stepped up campaigns to clamp down on smuggling and crimes along the entire border with Thailand.

But the Kelantan deputy chief minister admitted difficulties for authorities in his state as many border locations along the river are private property.

The two countries are separated concrete walls or fences in several border locations in Satun, Songkhla and Yala provinces. Some were built by the two countries, while others are unilateral projects.

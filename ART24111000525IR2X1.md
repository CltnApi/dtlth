Two pandas to arrive from China by 2027

The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE) is expected to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) next year on the transfer of two pandas from China, says permanent secretary Jatuporn Buruspat.

Mr Jatuporn provided an update yesterday on the progress of negotiations with Chinese authorities regarding the transfer of giant pandas from China to Chiang Mai Zoo.

The MNRE's efforts, supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have been making steady progress, he said.

He added the ministry plans to construct a new living area for the pandas, larger than the previous 6,250-square-metre air-conditioned enclosure. Construction details will be submitted to Chinese.

Mr Jatuporn said the two pandas are expected to arrive at Chiang Mai Zoo by 2027. "We did an excellent job caring for Xuang Xuang and Lin Hui, which produced offspring, Lin Bing. The new pandas will serve as goodwill ambassadors to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Thai-Chinese relations," he said.

In 2003, China agreed to loan two pandas, Xuang Xuang and Lin Hui, to Thailand's Chiang Mai Zoo. The pair attracted over seven million visitors and produced a female cub, Lin Bing, in 2009. Xuang Xuang passed away in 2019 at the age of 19, and Lin Hui died in 2023 at 21, both at Chiang Mai Zoo.

Their offspring, Lin Bing, was returned to Chengdu, China, in 2013. She is now reported to be the mother of seven.

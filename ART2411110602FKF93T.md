Thai singer Lisa of supergirl group Blackpink received two awards, for  best collaboration in a song and biggest fans, at the MTV Europe Music Awards, held in Manchester, England, on Sunday night.

Pop megastar Taylor Swift was the big winner, picking up four trophies and including one for a tribute to late singer Liam Payne.

Lisa, a 27-year-old from Buriram whose real name is Lalisa Manoban, received the award for best collaboration for her song _New Woman_, also featuring Spanish pop star Rosalia.

The 12 entrants in the biggest fans category were whittled down to two, Anitta and Lisa, before the announcer said, "Congratulations to all Lisa fans. Your support never goes unnoticed." 

Lisa is touring and was in Singapore on Monday, where a meet the fans event was planned at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.

Swift, who had led nominations with seven nods, won best artist, best video for her collaboration with Post Malone _Fortnight_, best live and best US act. Currently in North America for her Eras tour, she thanked fans via a video message.

"The fact that you have honoured the tour, everything that's happened with the album this year, the video, it's just unbelievable," said Swift, who released her latest album _The Tortured Poets Department_ in April.

South African singer Tyla followed with three prizes - best Afrobeats, best R&B and best African act.

The awards resumed after last year's Paris event was cancelled shortly after the outbreak of the Gaza war, in which Israel's military is fighting Hamas militants.

Held in a different city each year, Sunday's show took place at Manchester's new Co-Op Live venue.

Singer and third time MTV EMAs show host Rita Ora led a tribute to late One Direction member Liam Payne, who died last month after falling from a third-floor hotel room balcony in Buenos Aires. He was 31.

"He was a big part of the MTV world and my world and I think a lot of yours at home and everybody in here tonight," a visibly emotional Ora, who collaborated with Payne for 2018 song _For You_, said.

"He brought so much joy to every room he walked into and he left such a mark on this world."

Other winners on Sunday night included Sabrina Carpenter, whose hit _Espresso_ won best song, Ariana Grande who took the best pop award and Eminem who triumphed in the best hip-hop category.

Best K-pop went to Jimin, Mexican singer Peso Pluma won best latin while Manchester native Liam Gallagher took best rock. US singer Benson Boone won best new category.

Other honourees included US rapper Busta Rhymes, who performed a medley of his hits and received the global icon award and pop pioneer award recipients British electro-pop duo Pet Shop Boys, who closed the show.

Among Thai ghosts, the top three legends -- Mae Nak, Phee Pob and Phee Krasue -- have frequently featured in films and television series. According to Creative Economy Agency (CEA), Mae Nak has appeared in over 40 films and TV series while Phee Pob has made over 30 appearances in films and TV series.

To introduce Thais to other ghosts, the CEA collaborated with PURF, Kids Bloom and Assoc Prof Aphilak Kasempholkoon, a lecturer at the Faculty of Liberal Arts, Mahidol University, to organise the exhibition "The Untold Story". Running at Thailand Creative and Design Center, "The Untold Story" is divided into three sections -- Reviving Local Ghost Folklore; Greeting New Ghost Characters; and Preparing For Debut.

In the first section, Reviving Local Ghost Folklore, visitors can walk into a dark room illuminated by red lights. Here, visitors can listen to spooky stories from popular YouTube channels like Lon Diary (Haunted Diary) and The Ghost Radio which plays through a vintage transistor radio placed on a traditional Thai bamboo litter.

The next room features 12 pairs of headphones which play 12 different stories about local ghosts. These 12 Thai ghosts have never been depicted in any form before. After listening to these ghost stories, visitors are encouraged to draw the ghost they have heard about and pin their artwork on the surrounding walls. People will see that even when listening to the same story, everyone visualises and creates a different image.

The second section Greeting New Ghost Characters is the highlight.

Here, visitors will learn about 30 new Thai ghost characters based on research on local ghosts conducted by Assoc Prof Aphilak. Six artists -- Linghokkalom, Twofeetcat, Autumnberry, Tiicha, MarkSuttipong and Ployjaploen -- who previously worked on ghostly characters or are interested in spooky characters were selected to create new ghost characters.

Monnapa Panichkriangkrai, an exhibition curator and senior knowledge management officer at CEA, explained that this exhibition aims to raise awareness about the value of local cultural assets and to encourage Thais to use these assets.

"The Untold Story demonstrates the potential of local Thai ghosts that have never presented before. In addition to ghost radio programmes, TV series and films, the exhibition explores how ghosts can be created in other creative forms such as art toys, animations and games," said Monnapa.

"Since ghosts are often associated with fear, the first section of the exhibition presents this traditional perception. However, the challenge in creating this exhibition was to explore other aspects of these supernatural beings. Therefore, throughout the exhibition, the six artists present ghost characters in perspectives other than fear," Monnapa added.

Linghokkalom designed 15 ghosts based on northern folklores. She explained that these local ghosts offer a wide range of playful and diverse personalities. The designs emphasise their most recognisable features which can be remembered from just one glance.

"The story of Phee Taa Wod which is a half human and a half spirit creature was created to discourage children not to go out at night. The folklore tells that Phee Taa Wod with its soulless gaze, kidnaps children, puts them in a sack and takes them to be sacrificed. My favourite character is Phee Kai Noi, which appears as a small, cute and harmless chick and usually comes out at dusk. It does not harm people, but simply plays around and surprises people," explained Linghokkalom.

Twofeetcat, who is in charge of ghosts from Isan folklore, wanted her characters to be fun and be able to interact with audiences because she believes that ghosts do not always have to be scary. They can be playful and engaging characters.

"Phee Pao is a ghost with light coming from its nose and it eats raw food. It usually appears in damp locations and hunts frogs and toads at night. It has a peculiar habit of carrying a lot of cash around to bribe people to not talk about it," said Twofeetcat.

"Phee Pue Phuem is another forest guardian that was created so that children do not enter the forest at night. Phee Pue Phuem has outstretched hands in order to create a sense of interaction and be more appealing to children."

Autumnberry created ghosts from south Isan folklore. She also embraced the idea that ghosts do not have to be scary, so she created ghosts that resemble neighbours or people whom we can pass by on streets.

"Ma Ren Gong Viel means an animal caretaker who is a forest guardian, so Phee Ma Ren Gong Viel can appear as a dwarf who is an animal caretaker during the day and becomes a white orb at dusk. Another ghost in south Isan, Ja Gae Ka Mao is a black dog ghost which harms others according to the command of its keeper. I designed red beads for its necklace and its ankles to demonstrate that it has an owner."

Artist, Tiicha, used simple lines to create scary, mysterious but cute ghosts from the central region. Her two outstanding characters are Phee Ta Phu and Phee Ta Moi. Phee Ta Phu is a salt farm guardian and worshipping her brings a bountiful harvest. Meanwhile, Phee Ta Moi, which looks like a monkey dressed in farmer clothes, usually steals rice from farmers.

To make ghost characters easy to recognise, MarkSuttipong, who created ghost characters from the South, uses simple shapes -- like circles and ovals -- combined with various lines. Ghostly characters are depicted in shades of grey to represent feelings of fear and vengeance, while human characters appear in vibrant colours.

"Phee Lang Kluang appears like an ordinary man. If it does not remove its shirt, nobody will know that it is a ghost. Phee Lang Kluang is kind, but mischievous. He often appears in the evening and asks farmers if they need help growing rice. If farmers agree, in the morning, they will find their rice fields a mess. Phee Lang Kluang's weakness is that he is afraid of fish."

Due to the presence of various ethnic groups in Thailand, ethnic ghosts are also included in the exhibition. Artist Ployjaploen drew Phee Ya Ngaw, which is considered the mother of nature of the Sakai or Mani people who live in the Banthat mountain range in Trang province. She also created a Chinese ghost character, Nha Gow, which is also a traditional ritual which invites a female ghost to possess itself in a basket and read someone's fortune.

The final section, Preparing For Debut, is a video that summarises Thai ghosts in showbusiness in the past as well as introduces 30 new characters and divides them into two groups: good ghosts and evil ghosts.

The exhibition curator, Monnapa, hopes that visitors will at least remember one of the 30 ghost characters.

"Thai ghosts which appear in the media have been repetitive for many years. We hope that we can introduce new ghost characters into the entertainment business. Aside from the exhibition, there will be activities that people can participate in such as telling ghost stories, designing ghost characters and writing screenplays about local ghosts. This may be a starting point for utilising local assets and stories to further drive the creative industry."

"The Untold Story" runs at TCDC Bangkok, Gallery Room, 1st floor, until Nov 22. Admission is free. For more information, visit facebook.com/tcdc.thailand.

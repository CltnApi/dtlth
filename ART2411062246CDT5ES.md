Maris: Relationship with US 'robust'

Foreign Affairs Minister Maris Sangiampongsa said Thailand's relationship with the US will remain strong regardless of the outcome of the presidential election.

Speaking on Wednesday at Wing 6's Military Terminal 2 in Bangkok's Don Muang district, Mr Maris emphasised the election results would not affect Thailand's longstanding diplomatic ties with the US.

"Our relationship with the US is robust, consistent, and longstanding. Regardless of who becomes the next US president, our mutual goals and cooperation remain steadfast," he said.

The minister also said that under Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra's administration, Thailand prioritises balanced international partnerships that bring fair benefits to both sides.

He expressed confidence this foundational approach would maintain stability and fairness in Thailand-US relations.

Regarding potential shifts in relations between the two nations, Mr Maris said any adjustments in Thailand's diplomatic strategy would be based on open dialogue between authorities and various sectors.

He highlighted various forms of collaboration, including government-to-government (G2G), private-sector partnerships, and citizen-led initiatives.

Meanwhile, the US embassy on Wednesday held "The 2024 Election Watch" reception at the US ambassador's residence, providing participants with a chance to witness the US presidential election and learn more about the American electoral process.

US Ambassador Robert F Godec, in his remarks, said that regardless of the election outcome, bilateral relations would remain strong.

He acknowledged that while some may question when the results would be finalised, the integrity of the electoral process is what matters most.

He said the US would have a new president chosen by the American people by January 2025.

"Whatever the result, I can assure you the United States' partnership with Thailand will remain strong.

"Our deep and important relationship is woven from ties in trade, investment, security, education, and our people-to-people connections.

"Thailand was America's first friend in Asia, and our diplomatic relations span over 190 years. None of that will change," he said.

When asked how a potential Donald Trump victory might affect the Thai-US relationship, Mr Godec said again that the bond would remain strong, though policies and programmes may vary depending on the election outcome.

He said that while much is said during election campaigns, it is essential to see the actual policies once the president is in office, as Congress, including the Senate, plays a significant role in shaping American policy.

"So, we'll see who the American people choose and what specific policies and programmes are implemented. But I want to emphasise again -- Thailand is an extraordinarily important country for the US, and I believe the relationship between the two countries will remain strong," he added.

Meanwhile, People's Party (PP) list-MP and spokesman Parit Wacharasindhu commented on the possible implications of a Trump victory, cautioning that heightened US-China tensions under Mr Trump's leadership could affect Thailand, creating both challenges and opportunities.

For example, if the US imposes higher tariffs on Chinese goods, some of those goods could be redirected to Thailand, potentially affecting Thai products.

However, he said, if manufacturing bases in China were to relocate to Thailand, it could attract investors and boost employment.

Mr Parit also said that Mr Trump's limited focus on climate change presents another challenge.

With recent severe weather events, such as floods in northern Thailand, climate resilience is an urgent priority.

He urged Thailand to strengthen global partnerships to combat climate change effectively.

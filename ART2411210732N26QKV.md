Jury still out on Thaksin's 'dual citizenship'

Foreign Affairs Minister Maris Sangiampongsa yesterday downplayed reports that former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's role as a campaign assistant for the Pheu Thai Party may be illegal as he holds dual citizenship.

Mr Maris declined to comment on whether Thaksin holds citizenship of other countries.

Political activist Sonthiya Sawasdee has petitioned the Election Commission (EC), seeking a probe into Thaksin's involvement as a campaign assistant for the party.

Mr Sonthiya also raised concern about reports Thaksin had purchased a second citizenship in Montenegro or another country, noting Montenegro prohibits dual citizenship.

Transport Minister and key Pheu Thai figure Suriya Jungrungreangkit said the party's legal team had discussed the reports.

He said it found Thaksin had not broken any law when he helped Pheu Thai campaign for the Udon Thani provincial administrative organisation chairmanship last week. "The team studied the law and found there was nothing to worry about,'' Mr Suriya said.

Meanwhile, Mr Maris said fugitive former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra -- Thaksin's sister -- had not contacted the Foreign Affairs Ministry to pursue her plans to return to Thailand from exile.

Nikkei Asia on Monday published an interview Thaksin gave in Udon Thani province last Thursday. It quoted Thaksin as saying Yingluck should be able to return during or just prior to the Songkran festival next April.

He was quoted as saying he did not see any obstacles to her return.

Thaksin said in April that Yingluck might return this year.

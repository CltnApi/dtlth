National police chief Pol Gen Kitrat Phanphet has ordered an investigation into allegations that a lecturer at the Police Cadet Academy and a police interrogator made a cadet intoxicated and molested him at the academy.

Pol Gen Kitrat said on Wednesday that he instructed the commander of the academy that any wrongdoer would face strict disciplinary action and potential misconduct penalties. He also advised the affected cadet to file an official complaint.

There were reports that the lecturer was a police major who taught English and law at the academy in Samphran district of Nakhon Pathom.

The cadet was reportedly lured to a locker room near the rugby field last Saturday night.

There, the lecturer and another officer allegedly had the cadet drink three bottles of liquor and two additional bottles of beer while attempting to masturbate him.

There were also reports that the cadet may not be the only victim of the accused officers, who are former classmates at the academy.

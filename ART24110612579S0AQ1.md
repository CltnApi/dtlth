PHUKET - Amerigo Vespucci, a tall ship of the Italian Navy named after the 16th century explorer, has arrived at Phuket Deep Sea Port and is welcoming visitors aboard to explore an exhibition of Italian art, culture and architecture.

The 94-year-old ship is on a [three-year world tour](https://tourvespucci.it/en/come-aboard/) to promote Italy’s long history and rich culture. Its next port of call after Phuket will be India.

Aside from the onboard exhibition, the ship also boasts an Italian restaurant.

Admission to the exhibition is free but advance registration is required. Visiting hours are as follows:

*   Thursday: 10am to noon and 2pm to 7pm
*   Friday and Saturday: 10am to noon and 3pm to 5pm
*   Sunday: 10.30am to 12.30pm and 3pm until 7pm.

Vice Adm Suwat Donsakun, chief of the Third Naval Area Command, said his personnel would be responsible for ensuring the security of the Italian ship until it departs.

The command sent out two patrol boats and a patrol helicopter to welcome the ship on Tuesday afternoon and escort it to the port.

DDC sounds alarm as Evali vaping disease detected

The first case of Evali disease found in Buri Ram is worrying the Department of Disease Control (DDC) which fears a growing number of cases which are linked to e-cigarettes.

Evali, which stands for Vaping-associated pulmonary injury, is the name of a lung disease associated with e-cigarettes, or vaping products, the DDC says.

Dr Chayanan Sittibusaya, director of the Division of Tobacco Product Committee, said the first Evali case reported this year concerned a man, 32, admitted to Buri Ram Hospital. He was coughing up blood and his condition quickly developed into acute and severe pneumonia. "We don't usually encounter acute pneumonia and the symptoms worsened quickly within 24 to 36 hours. In this case, he had to be put on a ventilator.

"All tests for infection, such as Covid-19, RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus), and others, showed negative," he said. After the patient was able to remove his breathing tube, he told doctors he took about 400 puffs of an e-cigarette per day, every day.

It is unclear how long he had pursued such an aggressive smoking habit. However, he also had underlying diseases including diabetes and high blood pressure. A detailed physical examination of the patient revealed white patches on his lungs.

The patient's condition is now improving overall and there is no infection of any kind, including viruses, fungi, or bacteria, he said. However, the patient did have symptoms similar to nicotine withdrawal.

The hospital contacted the Buri Ram Provincial Public Health Office to investigate the disease further. "We have encouraged all hospitals to report Evali cases to us. We are afraid Evali disease is likely to increase because young people gain access to e-cigarettes very easily," he said.

E-cigarettes are prohibited in the country, but they are sold both online and offline, despite the authorities' vow to deal with them, he said. Many academic studies have discovered that e-cigarettes include numerous harmful substances, including nicotine and heavy metals. The DDC advised people to avoid using e-cigarettes, particularly those with chronic conditions because they can cause abrupt lung infections and death.

Lone dugong spotted in Trang survey

Only one dugong was found during a week-long survey of a seagrass meadow in Trang that is known for dugong sightings, raising concerns about the species' survival in the area, according to the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP).

The survey, which was carried out by officials from DNP's Marine National Operation Centre 3 and rangers from Hat Chao Mai National Park, was conducted between Nov 13-19.

The week-long survey focused on the seagrass meadow that extends from Yong Lam Beach to Koh Muk, but only one dugong was sighted during the period. The area, the report noted, was previously known for dugong sightings.

As seagrass cover in the area has significantly decreased, the team even laid out sarai phom nang seaweed and other species of edible seagrasses for the dugongs, but only one came out throughout the week.

The team suspected the dugongs may have migrated to areas around Phuket in search of food.

According to Asst Prof Thon Thamrongnawasawat, deputy dean of the Faculty of Fisheries at Kasetsart University, said more dugong deaths have been reported over the past two years, with the figure rising from one a month to 3-4 deaths per month.

This month alone, five dead dugongs were found off the coast of Krabi, Phuket and Trang.

The loss of seagrass in the area cover has also affected local fishermen, as valuable catches that live in seagrass meadows have also disappeared.

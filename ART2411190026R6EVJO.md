The beauty of cultural fusion is portrayed through art during "Bailemos", which is running at the Art Exhibition Space, 5th floor of Siam Discovery, Rama I Road, until Sunday.

Presented by the Embassy of Colombia to foster cultural ties between Thailand and Colombia, the must-see exhibition features an extraordinary collection of vibrant, culturally blended artwork from Colombian-French artist David Rodriguez.

Known for his work in cultural exchange, Rodriguez's paintings reflect a blend of Thai and Colombian cultures, merging the beauty of traditional Thai dance, such as ram Thai and khon, with Colombia's dance forms.

This new artwork, on display for the first time, reveals how rhythmic dance movements parallel the brushstrokes on canvas of vivid colours and shapes. These lines and forms embody the rhythm of dance, combining both concrete and abstract elements.

As suggested in the exhibition's title which means "let's dance" in Spanish, this art project celebrates a lively expression of cultural identity and the artist's own vibrant experiences.

Also showcased are Rodriguez's paintings that have travelled the globe, infused with humour and curiosity that inspire deep introspection and human self-expression.

There is no admission fee. Call 02-658-1000.

ONE Championship announces two title fights for January’s ONE Fight Night 27 card

ONE Championship has announced two big title fights will headline its ONE Fight Night 27 card on January 11 in Bangkok.

The main event will see China’s Tang Kai defend his featherweight MMA title, when he faces No 5-ranked Akbar Abdullaev. 

The Kyrgyzstani prospect has been on a tear with three straight wins in ONE, though Tang is 8-0 in the promotion.

An interim atomweight MMA title fight between Denice Zamboanga and Alyona Rassohyna will serve as the co-main event at Lumpinee Stadium.

The fight has been rebooked after falling off October’s ONE Fight Night 25 card, with the winner set to face divisional champ Stamp Fairtex, who is recovering from surgery on a meniscus tear.

Stamp recently told the Bangkok Post she is targeting a timeframe of March of April 2025 to return to the ring.

No 2-ranked atomweight Zamboanga is riding three straight wins in ONE, following back-to-back defeats by No 1 Ham Seo Hee. 

Rassohyna, meanwhile, has not fought in more than three years since losing a decision in a rematch with Stamp, with whom she is tied 1-1 having submitted the Thai in February 2021.

South Korea’s Ham again hit out on social media over being omitted from ONE’s plans for the interim title fight.

“It’s a fake champion, no matter who wins,” the 37-year-old said on Instagram on Friday. “Fake champion match.”

The veteran suffered a TKO loss to Stamp Fairtex when the vacant title was on the line in September 2023, and Zamboanga has insisted it is “time for others to get their chance”.

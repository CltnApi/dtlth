The event welcomed Mr Pakornwut Udompipatskul, (Second) Vice-Chairperson of the Committee, along with subcommittee members, to witness and participate in testing the emergency alert system, which will be launched in Thailand for the first time.

Mr Chakkrit Urairat, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer of True Corporation Plc., stated, “True Corporation has reached another milestone in preparing the Cell Broadcast Service (CBS) system for launch in Thailand, with a live demonstration for the Committee on Communications, Telecommunications, and Digital Economy and Society of the House of Representatives to ensure confidence in CBS standards. We are ready to implement this system in cooperation with all stakeholders. This highly efficient emergency alert system follows international standards and can deliver warning messages to all mobile phones in affected areas simultaneously, whether to Thai citizens or international tourists, without requiring pre-registration. Key features of the system include support for five languages: Thai, English, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or others as needed. Additionally, it provides both audio alerts and on-screen pop-up messages, along with Text-to-Speech functionality to accommodate visually impaired users, ensuring comprehensive alert coverage for all population groups.”

Mr Pakornwut Udompipatskul, (Second) Vice-Chairperson of the Committee on Communications, Telecommunications, and Digital Economy and Society of the House of Representatives, commented, “The Committee on Communications places great importance on Cell Broadcast technology, especially in light of unexpected incidents such as shopping mall shootings or flood disasters that impact people’s lives and property. An efficient warning system can significantly reduce losses. Thailand has learned from the experiences of several countries already using this system, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, India, and Malaysia, with the service expected to launch next year.”

The CBS system developed by True Corporation features five key highlights:

*   **Language Support:** Capable of designing and sending alerts in any language simultaneously.
*   **Speed:** Capable of sending disaster alert messages immediately when incidents occur.
*   **Accuracy:** Can precisely define target areas for message delivery.
*   **Coverage:** Sends messages to all users in disaster-prone areas without registration.
*   **Reliability:** Recognised and operational in many countries worldwide.

The CBS system’s development is a collaboration between True Corporation, the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society, NBTC, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DDPM), and the Meteorological Department, with the BNIC (Business and Network Intelligence Centre) equipped with Artificial Intelligence (AI) serving as the central hub for 24-hour disaster management.

Furthermore, True Corporation showcased the Business and Network Intelligence Centre (BNIC) to the Committee on Communications, Telecommunications, and Digital Economy and Society of the House of Representatives. This centre, which utilises Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, serves as a war room for disaster management, enhancing operational efficiency and building confidence among True and dtac customers, thereby supporting the CBS system’s effectiveness.

This live demonstration marks another significant step in elevating Thailand’s security and disaster alert measures, which will help reduce the loss of life and property among Thai citizens and tourists. The service is expected to officially launch in 2025.

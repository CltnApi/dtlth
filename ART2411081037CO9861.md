Central Department Store Group, under Central Retail, has partnered with The 1—Thailand’s largest digital lifestyle and loyalty platform with over 21 million members—to launch The 1 EXPAT, a membership program that redefines the shopping experience for expatriates in Thailand. Integrated within The 1 APP, The 1 EXPAT is designed to provide expats with not only tailored shopping privileges but also access to a vibrant community and unique O2O (online-to-offline) experiences crafted specifically for their lifestyle.

_**Ms. Rvisra Chirathivat, Chief Marketing Officer, Central Department Store Group, Central Retail,** said, “We've identified significant growth potential within the expat segment, driven by their substantial purchasing power. In 2023, expat customers—with a 65% penetration rate among skilled expatriates in Thailand and spending 2.5 times more than local customers—played a crucial role in driving the growth and success of CRC's business units. In response, we've developed The 1 EXPAT, an exclusive membership program designed to enhance the refined and seamless shopping experience for the expatriate community._

_"Central Department Store Group has long been the preferred destination for expats when it comes to lifestyle needs, as our business spans all aspects of living. With this strong foundation, we are launching The 1 EXPAT to better serve and cater to the unique needs of the expat community in Thailand. This initiative aligns with the customer-centric strategy of Central Department Store Group in 2024, which prioritises growth in the expat segment as one of our key focuses, aiming to build lasting relationships within the expat community."_

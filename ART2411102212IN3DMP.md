Chanathip Songkrasin and Jaroensak Wonggorn helped BG Pathum United edge Uthai Thani 2-1 in an exciting **Thai League** 1 tussle at home on Saturday night.

Pathum United nearly got an early goal but Teerasil Dangda's header was saved by Uthai Thani goalkeeper Boonyakiat Wongsajam.

Uthai Thani also had an opportunity to claim the lead in the 23rd minute but Ricardo Santos was denied by Pathum United goalkeeper Saranon Anuin. The Rabbits got their first goal in the 36th minute from a long shot by Chanathip Songkrasin.

In the second half, Uthai Thani bounced back into the game as Ricardo Santos produced the equaliser for the visitors.

Pathum secured the winning goal in the 84th minute through Jaroensak Wonggorn.

After the match, Pathum United interim coach Surachai Jaturapattarapong said: "It was not an easy game for our team. All teams know how to play with us. It all depends on which team gets the chance to score.

"Every game, we try to do our best and this game is another lesson for us."

Hosts PT Prachuap put on a fine show as they defeated Ratchaburi 3-2 on Saturday night.

Ratchaburi got the first goal in the 29th minute from Clement Depres and an own goal by Amirali Chegini gave them a 2-0 advantage after 43 minutes. Prachuap fought back in the second half through goals from Airton Tirabassi (52), Phanthamit Praphanth (77) and Saharat Kanyaroj (82). Meanwhile, hosts Nakhon Ratchasima picked up three points after a 2-0 victory over Chiang Rai United.

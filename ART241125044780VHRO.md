Amidst the global buzz surrounding Bitcoin, the world’s leading digital currency that recently hit a new all-time high of $99,000 (3,465,000 baht) per BTC on November 21, a major stir occurred in online and cryptocurrency investment communities. Worawat Narknawdee (Acme), with the moniker ‘Acme Traderist,’ announced his support for Bitcoin as a reserve asset of Thailand on his Acme Traderist – Worawat Narknawdee Facebook page. He posted: “If Thailand needs ‘Bitcoin’ (BTC) as a reserve fund, contact me via inbox,” accompanied by the hashtag #AcmeTraderist. 

The post quickly gained traction, attracting numerous comments and shares. Some users even tagged the Facebook pages of the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand to ensure the statement reached the relevant authorities. 

Mr. Worawat Narknawdee, a renowned 36-year-old Thai businessman and investor, is widely recognised in financial technology (Fintech), particularly in trading assets and digital assets. He revealed that he currently serves as the CEO of “Bitnance,” a fintech company he founded in 2021 with a registered capital of 150 million baht. He is also the Traderist group founder, an initiative to empower individuals with investment and life management knowledge and skills. The group’s mission is to help people achieve success so they can, in turn, assist others. For over 12 years, the Traderist group has provided free education, earning him a reputation as a prominent trader and investor. He now boasts 5,000,000 followers worldwide.

"I was among the first group in Thailand to study cryptocurrency and blockchain, and I was a self-funded Bitcoin miner during the initial three years of Bitcoin's existence. At that time, Bitcoin was unregulated and not widely accepted by the general public. I started mining Bitcoin in 2012 when it was worth less than 5,000 baht per BTC, and I became one of the top Bitcoin miners globally. Later, in 2014, the collapse of Mt.Gox, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, caused the price of Bitcoin to plummet. I decided to stop mining Bitcoin and sold all my mining equipment and assets, gathering 30 million baht to buy Bitcoin for 10,000 baht per BTC. This increased my holdings by over 3,000 BTC, making me the largest Bitcoin holder in Thailand today." 

“I subsequently invested part of my Bitcoin holdings into various global ventures. My largest investment was in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), primarily focusing on Dubai, where I allocated over 10 billion baht (approximately 300 million US dollars) across sectors such as luxury real estate, services, and fintech in 2023,” Mr. Worawat added. 

"In the past, I've twice set a record for the largest Bitcoin giveaway. The first came in 2017 during a digital currency education event at Show DC. There, I distributed 13 BTC to 1,690 attendees. The second was in 2021 when I awarded 3 BTC to 5,601 fans and followers worldwide during a DoubleDeep concert (which featured the hit song ‘Bitcoin (New Dream)’ inspired by my real-life experiences). These two giveaways totalled over 16 BTC, equivalent to approximately 55,440,000 baht (based on Bitcoin’s value as of November 22, 2024, according to [www.investing.com](http://www.investing.com/))."

Moreover, I founded a digital currency, also known as cryptocurrency, named “ACT (ACET)” in 2021. The cryptocurrency is currently held by over 150,000 holders worldwide, with a total trading value of approximately $381,000,000 (13,175,000,000 baht). 

“In 2023, I was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Finance from the European International University, Paris (EIU-Paris). This recognition was given for my expertise in finance and investment, making me one of only three global influencers in financial technology to receive this honour,” Mr. Worawat added. 

While the exact number of Bitcoins owned by Mr. Worawat has not yet been disclosed, sources from the crypto community have estimated his holdings to be at least 11,000 BTC. Therefore, it’s reasonable to assume that Mr. Worawat has more than twice the amount of Bitcoins held by the government of El Salvador, which declared Bitcoin legal tender in 2021.

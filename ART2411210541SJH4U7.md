Stephen Irvine believes KO ‘failure’ cost him ONE Championship contract, vows to return

Stephen Irvine put the blame squarely on his shoulders for not securing a ONE Championship contract last week, but “El Matador” has vowed to get the job done next time out.

The 24-year-old secured a unanimous decision victory in his 129lbs catchweight Muay Thai bout with Denkriangkrai Singha Mawynn, which served as the co-main event at ONE Friday Fights 87.

Irvine put in a dominant display, using all eight “limbs” to outclass his Thai opponent and rack up a fifth victory at Bangkok’s Lumpinee Stadium since debuting in the promotion 18 months ago.

With just one loss on his record – a majority decision – and three knockouts, many observers thought the Scottish fighter might have done enough to clinch a US$100,000 contract and a spot on the Asia-based martial arts promotion’s main roster.

It was not to be, but Irvine remains undeterred.

“I thought I put in a great performance,” Irvine told the Bangkok Post. 

“But I knew that I would have to knock out my opponent to get the contract. I failed to do so, so that’s on me. 

“But the next one has to be the one that gets me the contract for sure.”

Irvine’s revelation in fight week that he is set to become a father for the first time next year will no doubt give him extra motivation and incentive – if any was needed – to seal the deal in his next outing.

“I’ve had to share the ring with a lot of top opponents who have all been champions at some point of their career,” Irvine added.

“This is preparing me for when the time comes.”

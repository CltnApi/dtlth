SRT defies DoL in Buri Ram dispute

The State Railway of Thailand (SRT) has appealed the Department of Lands (DoL) decision not to revoke land title documents issued for plots of land in Buri Ram's Khao Kradong area.

SRT governor Veeris Ammarapala said yesterday the SRT submitted the petition objecting to the DoL's decision on Tuesday following an order from Transport Minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit.

The appeal challenges a recent decision by a DoL committee, set up under Section 61 of the Land Code, to examine the boundaries of Khao Kradong. This decision contradicts a 2021 Supreme Court ruling that confirmed the disputed land plots covering 5,083 rai belong to the SRT.

Mr Veeris said the SRT has established guidelines to resolve the land dispute with the occupants if the DoL decides to revoke the land ownership documents. Under these guidelines, the occupants will be allowed to rent the land from the SRT, ensuring they remain in compliance with the law.

According to the governor, the SRT has strictly adhered to the law in addressing the land controversy in the Khao Kradong area and ensured that the process is transparent and fair.

Meanwhile, Bhumjaithai leader Anutin Charnvirakul insisted yesterday that there was no conflict between his party and the ruling Pheu Thai Party over the Khao Kradong land controversy.

Mr Anutin, the interior minister, is in charge of the DoL while Mr Suriya of Pheu Thai oversees the SRT.

The Bhumjaithai leader said he has no vested interest in the land dispute, and the agencies involved are responsible for resolving the matter in line with the law and court orders.

He said if the process is not in compliance with the law, people can file a complaint with the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) while the SRT can also appeal to the court.

"I have nothing to do with the Khao Kradong area and have no reason to protect anyone's interest," he said, apparently referring to reports that some areas belong to the Chidchob family, which is said to wield considerable power in Bhumjaithai.

People's Party list MP Jullapong Yooket said yesterday the DoL's decision not to revoke the land ownership documents has left the public bewildered. "The public can't help but wonder why the decision contradicts the Supreme Court's ruling and how this land saga will end," he said.

He said the land controversy has resulted from exploitation of the complexity of the Land Code, the DoL's regulations and administrative law, which are difficult for the general public to understand.

He also questioned if some committee members have connections with influential figures, saying there could be more hidden in the Khao Kradong land controversy.

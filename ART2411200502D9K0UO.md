SONGKHLA - Three people, one a 9-year-old, were injured by two exploding grenades fired into a construction camp for the world’s tallest Guanyin statue in Thepha district on Wednesday morning.

The attack occurred at the statue's construction site in Ban Pak Bang Sakom in tambon Sakom about 6.10am.

Somporn Namkheow, 45, from Chaiyaphum province, suffered shrapnel wounds all over his body and Don Kaewloy, 46, from Kalasin, suffered wounds to her left leg.

The 9-year-old girl, Manthita Withawet, from Kalasin, had wounds to her head and neck.

All were taken to Thepha Hospital.

The explosions started fires in the workers camp and wrecked a pickup truck.

At the scene, police found leaflets in Thai and Myanmar languages with messages threatening the lives of people who dared to continue working at the site and elsewhere in the southern border provinces.

The 65-rai seaside area in Thepha belongs to TPI Polene Power Plc. The company is building a 136-metre-high Guanyin statue, which would make it the world's tallest and a new tourism landmark in the South.

The statue would also serve as a viewpoint tower. Construction started two years ago and is set for completion in 2026.

Currently, the tallest Guanyin statue stands 108 metres high and is on Hainan island in China.

In Chinese Buddhism, Guanyin is female, the bodhisattva of infinite compassion and mercy.

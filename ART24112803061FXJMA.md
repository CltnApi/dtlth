Police conducted multiple raids in the northern province of Chiang Mai and made the country’s biggest seizure of call scam equipment installed by a Thai-Chinese gang.

Pol Lt Gen Jirabhop Bhuridej, commissioner of the Central Investigation Bureau, told a press conference on Wednesday that police raided 11 rented houses in Muang, San Sai and San Kamphaeng districts of Chiang Mai on Tuesday and found 642 SIM boxes, 590,000 SIM cards, 72 computers, 1,455 mobile phones and 47 SIM card readers.

“It is the biggest raid of call scam equipment in Thailand,” the commissioner said.

During the raids, police also arrested 15 suspects comprising of two Thais, five Chinese and eight Myanmar people.

One of the Thai suspects is a woman, Jirapan Prakobkit, aged 30. Pol Lt Gen Jirabhop said her Chinese husband who was at large headed the call scam gang and the woman rented the houses where the devices were installed. She also paid rents and public utility fees for the houses.

“The SIM boxes were used to create fake social media accounts that were sold to call scam and online criminal gangs… They had the devices which were used with mobile phones to avoid security algorithms of social media which would consider the fake accounts as genuine ones,” the central investigation chief said.

He quoted Ms Jirapan, the arrested Thai suspect, as saying that her Chinese husband had bought the equipment and other arrested suspects were hired to stay at the rented houses where the SIM boxes were installed.

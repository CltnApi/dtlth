**Social responsibility**

With a culture of kindness right at the core of the school's ethos, the level of community engagement grows year-on-year. In recent months members of the school have supported organisations that provide aid to some of the most vulnerable members of our community and raised money in support of causes that seek solutions to the world’s biggest challenges.These efforts have fostered a strong sense of social responsibility in the pupils, who have been enthusiastic participants throughout.

**Sustainability** 

Sustainability has been at the forefront of the school’s agenda, with a variety of initiatives in place, including recycling programs, a reduction in single-use plastics, and the installation of solar panels to reduce the school’s carbon footprint and demonstrating the importance of giving back to the community and caring for the planet.

The British International School of the Year award is testament to the hard work and dedication of Brighton College Bangkok’s entire school – pupils, staff, parents and governors – and further inspires the school to continue its mission of providing an exceptional education for every pupil and an outstanding learning community for all.

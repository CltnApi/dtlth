Kimpton Maa-Lai Bangkok has partnered with the sustainable Thai fashion brand PIPATCHARA to create the Infinitude Christmas Tree, an ethereal four-metre-tall installation made from upcycled plastics, on display in the hotel lobby from 25 November 2024 to 5 January 2025. 

This year’s Christmas tree, a first-of-its-kind for PIPATCHARA, features 10,000 snowflake-like paillettes crafted from recycled plastic fruit crates sourced locally, forming the brand’s signature Infinitude pattern. Complemented by illuminated Infinitude lamps, the installation blends luxury and environmental responsibility into a striking festive centrepiece. 

Founded in 2018 by sisters Thapthim-Jitrinee and Petch-Pipatchara Kaeojiinda, PIPATCHARA has gained global acclaim for its stylishly sustainable creations. From hand-crafted macramé beginnings, the brand evolved into its Infinitude line, worn by icons like Lisa of Blackpink. This collaboration marks their debut in interior design, extending their innovative vision into new realms. 

“Kimpton Maa-Lai Bangkok and PIPATCHARA share a passion for sustainability and artistry,” said Patrick Both, Regional General Manager for IHG Hotels and Resorts. “Our annual Christmas tree showcases the creativity of local artists, delivering festive joy with a focus on environmental consciousness.”

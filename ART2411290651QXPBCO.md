ICONCRAFT, a space dedicated to Thai creative handicrafts, is adding heartfelt meaning to every gift this season through its collaboration with Artstory by Autistic Thai. Together, they have launched the “ICONCRAFT x Artstory Miracle of Gifts 2024” collection, a special range of products themed “A brooklet of fish and the sunlight on ripened grain, an abundance of nature.” Designed by talented Thai autistic children, this collection showcases their artistic skills and creativity. 

The **Miracle of Gifts Pop-up Store** invites ICONCRAFT customers to explore these unique and meaningful gifts that celebrate diversity. To discover something extraordinary for loved ones this festive season, visit the pop-up at **Charoen Nakhon Hall, M floor****,** and ICONCRAFT on the **4th and 5th floors of ICONSIAM**. 

The **“ICONCRAFT x Artstory Miracle of Gifts 2024” collection** is the result of an exclusive collaboration between ICONCRAFT and Artstory by Autistic Thai. ICONCRAFT is committed to empowering artists by helping them pursue their passions and build sustainable careers. Artstory by Autistic Thai focuses on highlighting the creative talents of autistic children, bringing their works into the spotlight for both Thai people and international visitors. This partnership not only provides career opportunities and boosts self-esteem for these young artists but also promotes equality and improves the quality of life for autistic children in a sustainable way. 

This initiative is supported by Siam Piwat through its **“Citizen of Love” project****,** ensuring the creations of autistic children gain recognition and appreciation from a wider audience. 

The primary designs in this collection are inspired by the theme **“A brooklet of fish and the sunlight on ripened grain, an abundance of nature.”** The central motif, the **carp**, symbolises fertility and prosperity. The young artists bring this concept to life with their unique storytelling, blending colours and patterns to express their individual creativity. The designs beautifully capture a sense of contemporary Thainess, reflecting ICONCRAFT’s identity. These patterns are thoughtfully developed into practical products, offering ICONCRAFT and ICONSIAM customers meaningful gift options for the New Year. 

The carp-patterned products in the **“ICONCRAFT x Artstory Miracle of Gifts 2024” collection** include t-shirts, Hawaiian shirts, tote bags, bucket hats, tumblers, notebooks, laptop bags, and more. Each piece is a limited edition, available exclusively during this festive season. By purchasing items from this collection, customers directly support the young artists of Artstory by Autistic Thai, encouraging them to continue their creative journeys. Every purchase represents a joyful act of giving, whether it’s for oneself or someone special. 

In addition, ICONCRAFT offers a wide range of creative Thai handicrafts, ideal for curating customised gift sets tailored to loved ones’ lifestyles this festive season.

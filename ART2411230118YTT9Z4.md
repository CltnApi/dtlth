Drainage workers have discovered nearly 150 skeletons while constructing and upgrading the road and drainage system in a small alley in the inner district of Hanoi.

**Ha Anh Tuan**, Deputy Chairman of the **Dong Da District People's Committee**, stated that the skeletons were found about one metre beneath the road surface in Alley 167, **Tay Son Street**, **Quang Trung Ward**, **Dong Da District**.

Following the discovery, **Quang Trung Ward** and **Dong Da District** authorities ordered the suspension of all infrastructure work in the area.

The remains were gathered into temporary ossuaries pending proper burial.

According to Tuan, authorities have so far identified most of the skeletons. **Quang Trung Ward** officials have coordinated with relevant agencies to transfer the remains to an appropriate cemetery.

Alley 167 resident **Le Thi Thu Thao** noted that this is not the first time skeletons have been uncovered during construction in the area.

In the past, remains were frequently found during roadwork, drainage installation or foundation digging. These remains, often contained in ceramic ossuaries, were relocated for reburial elsewhere.

“Years ago, when the city consolidated scattered graves, unclaimed graves were moved here and later forgotten,” Thao explained.

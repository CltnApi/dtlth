Huawei Technologies (Thailand) Co., Ltd. has achieved a remarkable milestone by being honoured with the prestigious **HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn's Thailand Corporate Excellence Awards 2024 Trophy** for three years straight at the TMA Excellence Awards 2024 held at The Athenee Hotel, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Bangkok on November 21. This year’s award in the 'Innovation Excellence' category underscores Huawei's unwavering commitment to innovation, excellence, and sustainable development in Thailand.

The recognition was conferred by the Thailand Management Association (TMA) in collaboration with the Sasin School of Management at Chulalongkorn University. The award ceremony, presided over by Privy Councilor Chirayu Isarangkun na Ayuthaya, was held in front of HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn's image. Mr. David Li, Chief Executive Officer of Huawei Technologies (Thailand), received the royal award, witnessed by distinguished guests.

This prestigious accolade marks Huawei Thailand's third consecutive win, highlighting the company's enduring commitment to excellence in innovation, infrastructure enhancement, and fostering digital talent inclusivity. Huawei’s sustained efforts have positioned Thailand as a leading digital hub in ASEAN, driving economic progress and technological innovation. Together with the Royal Trophy of Innovation Excellence, Huawei also won the Distinguished Award for the Product/Service Excellence.

**Privy Councilor Chirayu Isarangkun na Ayuthaya** emphasised the importance of adaptability in today’s fast-changing world, stating "In today’s ever-changing world, it is not only the rapid technological advancements that require us to adapt and evolve, but also the growing challenges of climate change, which have become increasingly severe. These issues, evident both in Thailand and globally, compel us to adapt and transform effectively to face emergencies—be they economic, political, or environmental—that will impact our lives and businesses in the future."

**Mr. Nithi Patarachoke****, Chairman of TMA,** highlighted the resilience required to navigate today’s challenges, remarking: "TMA is committed to empowering Thailand’s business sector to advance with resilience and stability, fostering sustainable economic growth amid today’s highly challenging landscape. From trade wars and geopolitical tensions to economic hurdles and fierce competition due to global oversupply, the path to survival lies in building strength, striving for excellence, and becoming truly outstanding organisations."

Over the past 25 years in Thailand, Huawei has been dedicated to growing alongside the nation and contributing to its progress through innovation and collaboration."

In partnership with operators, Huawei has established ASEAN's leading 5G network, enabling AI-driven connectivity in high-density areas such as BTS stations and shopping malls, while supporting community initiatives like the ‘One Tambon, One Product’ project.

Technical Ceramic: a material with a lasting allure 

As 2024 draws to a close, Maurice Lacroix unveils a masterpiece that merges technical innovation with timeless style: the **AIKON Automatic Ceramic**. This striking addition to the AIKON collection offers a captivating blend of urban sophistication and cutting-edge materials, delivered in two contrasting finishes—stealthy black and radiant white—and available in 39mm and 42mm sizes. 

Crafted over three years of meticulous research and development, the AIKON Automatic Ceramic is more than a watch; it’s a statement. By using **technical ceramic**, a material that enhances the properties of conventional ceramic, Maurice Lacroix has set a new benchmark in luxury watchmaking.

**Revolutionising Ceramic: Technical Excellence Meets Everyday Elegance** 

Ceramic cases have long been admired for their scratch resistance and hypoallergenic properties, but Maurice Lacroix has pushed the boundaries with its technical ceramic innovation. By doping zirconium oxide with hafnium, yttrium, and aluminium oxides, the material achieves unparalleled durability, thermal stability, and strength—qualities that ensure the watch will remain pristine for years to come. 

The result is a timepiece that’s as robust as it is refined. The case and bracelet feature intricate surfaces and polished facets that exude luxury, while the bracelet’s smoothly articulated links ensure maximum comfort. This harmonious fusion of aesthetics and ergonomics is a testament to Maurice Lacroix’s commitment to perfection. 

**From Concept to Reality: Designed for Everyday Sophistication** 

Maurice Lacroix’s journey to create the AIKON Automatic Ceramic wasn’t without challenges. The bezel, with its distinctive arms and contrasting finishes, posed technical hurdles during production. Similarly, crafting a bracelet from technical ceramic required precision to allow for fluid movement and optimal fit. 

Feedback from retailers and watch enthusiasts was integral to fine-tuning the design. The end result is a unisex timepiece that balances elegance and performance, appealing to urbanites seeking a versatile yet sophisticated accessory. 

**Contrasts That Captivate** 

The AIKON Automatic Ceramic is a lesson in contrasts, offering two distinct personas: 

*   **Matt Black (42mm):** Evoking a nocturnal urban vibe, this model is stealthy and bold, perfect for after-dark adventures. 
    

*   **Glossy White (39mm):** Radiating angelic charm, this version is a daytime showstopper, ideal for basking in the limelight. 
    

Whether you’re seeking understated sophistication or eye-catching brilliance, there’s an AIKON to match your mood and style. 

**The Evolution of the AIKON Legacy** 

The AIKON collection traces its roots back to 2016, inspired by Maurice Lacroix’s iconic Calypso model of the 1990s. Since then, it has become a symbol of urban style, catering to a cosmopolitan audience that values bold design and high perceived value. With each iteration, the AIKON has embraced new materials, colours, and complications, solidifying its place as a modern classic. 

The introduction of the technical ceramic models further elevates this legacy, offering a luxury timepiece that’s both innovative and accessible.

Prime Minister **Paetongtarn Shinawatra** took to social media yesterday to thank the public for their support during her recovery from **bronchitis**, saying she was feeling better.

Ms Paetongtarn posted a set of photos yesterday, including pictures with her two children.

"The doctor suggested I rest for one more day, but thanks to my two little nurses, I think I have now recovered," she said.

"I apologise for having had to cancel all the appointments that were scheduled for today due to my illness," the prime minister said.

According to a government source, Ms Paetongtarn took sick leave yesterday after being diagnosed with bronchitis, which caused a sore throat and hoarse voice, though no Covid-19 infection was detected.

Ms Paetongtarn is expected to resume her duties today. She is scheduled to visit the government's narcotic suppression model operation in the northeastern province of Roi Et.

High-profile lawyer Sittra Biabungkerd, who was arrested along with his wife Patthitta Biabungkerd on fraud and money-laundering charges, has decided not to apply for bail for himself but intends to seek temporary release for her, their lawyer said on Friday.

Saiyud Pengboonchu, the couple's lawyer, told reporters at the Criminal Court on Friday that he would not submit a bail application for Mr Sittra due to the serious nature of the case, which involves significant damages. The arrest warrant stated that releasing the suspect could lead to evidence tampering and posed a flight risk, especially amid rumours that they were attempting to flee.

If there is insufficient evidence, the chances of granting bail would be slim, said Mr Saiyud.

Crime Suppression Division (CSD) police took the couple to the Criminal Court on Friday to seek their detention. The officers opposed their bail, arguing that they posed a flight risk and might interfere with evidence.

Mr Sittra, alias "Lawyer Tam," had shown no intention to flee. When they were arrested on Thursday, Mr Sittra and his wife were on their way to make merit at a temple in Chachoengsao province, according to their lawyer.

Before [the arrests](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2897978/lawyer-wife-arrested-for-alleged-fraud-money-laundering), lawyer Sittra had prepared a lawsuit and waited at his house for five days for the police to arrest him because he did not want to be [arrested while wearing pajamas](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2652502/big-jokes-house-searched-by-cyber-crime-police) like someone else, said Mr Saiyud.

Mr Sittra, 43, and Ms Patthitta, 41, were stopped by Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) officers while they were travelling in their Porsche Cayenne on a section of the Kabin Buri-Chachoengsao Highway in Phanom Sarakham district of Chachoengsao, heading away from Bangkok, on Thursday morning.

The arrest took place on the same day the Criminal Court issued warrants for the arrest of the couple, as requested by the CIB.  

Mr Sittra was charged with fraud and money laundering offences. His wife was charged with money laundering offences.  

Pol Maj Gen Suwat Saengnoom, the CIB deputy commissioner, on Thursday said the couple denied all charges and that police would oppose their temporary release on bail.

Police seized their Porsche with licence plate number Thor Kor 999, registered in Bangkok. They found travel bags, bedding and a file of documents inside.

Officers also searched Mr Sittra’s house in Taling Chan district of Bangkok in the afternoon and impounded dozens of items of jewellery and luxury bags for examination.

Mr Saiyud said Mr Sitttra showed no sign of worries, but his wife got stressed as she had never thought that she would face charges and be sent to a prison.

On Tuesday, Mr Sittra showed up at the CSD office to request that police question him in a case in which a Thai woman alleged that he tricked her out of 71 million baht with a claimed online lottery project. The lawyer told reporters that the woman had given him the sum as a gift.

The 58-year-old woman, Jatuporn "Madame Oy" Ubonlert, had recently filed her complaint with police and had been questioned by interrogators several times before the arrest warrant was issued.

The native of Nakhon Ratchasima province reportedly lives with her French husband in France and won a EuroMillions lottery jackpot worth several billion baht there.

On Friday, Somchart Phinit-aksorn, lawyer of Ms Jatuporn, arrived at the Criminal Court at about 10.30am to submit a request to oppose bail for Mr Sittra and his wife.

Lawyer Somchart said his client "Madame Oy" appeared indifferent after Mr Sittra was arrested.

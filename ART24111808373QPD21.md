Bitkub Group has once again made waves on social media. Jirayut (Topp) Srupsrisopa, Founder and Group CEO of Bitkub Capital Group Holdings, Thailand’s leading digital asset and blockchain company, introduced the world to Moodeang, the beloved baby pygmy hippo adored by fans globally. Moodeang appeared on a vibrant animated display in New York’s Times Square, extending an invitation to people worldwide to visit Thailand.

“I’m thrilled to showcase Moodeang to a global audience on a Times Square billboard,” shared Topp Jirayut. “In collaboration with Khao Kheow Open Zoo, Bitkub Capital Group aims to inspire international visitors to experience Thailand. We’re proud to contribute to boosting the country’s tourism and economy as the year draws to a close.”

Moodeang’s "soft power" influence reaches beyond tourism, connecting to the digital asset industry. Following a recent U.S. presidential election prediction collaboration, interest in digital assets has surged. Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of 3,145,000 baht on the Bitkub Exchange.

Adding to the momentum, Thailand will host **DevCon 2024**, the premier annual gathering for Ethereum network developers, from 12–15 November 2024 at The Queen Sirikit National Convention Center (QSNCC) in Bangkok. This significant event will draw global attention to Thailand’s digital asset sector, reinforcing its position as a key player in the blockchain and cryptocurrency world.

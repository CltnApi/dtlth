**GrabFood, the leading food delivery platform, invites foodies and art lovers to experience an extraordinary picnic vibe right in the heart of Bangkok at #GrabThumbsUp x NEWYEAR presents Quality Food, Quality Time in the Park. This exciting event brings together rising pop-art star NEWYEAR, known for the adorable dachshund character “Wednesday,” joins forces with five popular eateries — SOURI, PhedPhed, ROOTS, Ohkajhu, and Shake Shack — all proudly endorsed by #GrabThumbsUp for their exceptional flavours. This one-of-a-kind event infuses a delightful blend of art and gastronomy. Immerse yourself in captivating art installations and enjoy a whirlwind of fun activities over four fabulous days during November 14th-17th at CentralWorld's Eden Zone.**

Food and art transcend age and gender, connecting people through life’s moments and creating memorable experiences for everyone. As Thailand’s leading food delivery platform, GrabFood, through its flagship brand #GrabThumbsUp, is dedicated to delivering high-quality culinary experiences. This year-end, GrabFood celebrates the season with pop-up event titled **#GrabThumbsUp x NEWYEAR presents Quality Food, Quality Time in the Park,** where flavours meet artistry. In partnership with rising pop artist Paphakorn ‘NEWYEAR’ Srikunrayakorn – the creator of the adorable dachshund character “Wednesday” – and five popular eateries endorsed by #GrabThumbsUp, this event serves up signature dishes with a unique, artistic twist. CentralWorld’s Eden Zone will transform into a mesmerised park scene filled with enchanting character displays, including the giant-sized “GIANT WEDNESDAY,” ready to delight visitors with its whimsical charm.

Artist NEWYEAR shared her excitement about collaborating with GrabFood on this project: “As an artist, I’m thrilled to partner with GrabFood to bring a splash of joy and playfulness, enhancing the food experience in such a unique way. For this event, my character designs draw inspiration from a playful memory from my childhood when I would arrange food to look like faces – cucumber for eyes, seaweed for eyebrows, and tomatoes for a mouth, bringing each dish to life in its own way. These designs reflect those feelings and childhood imagination, told through Wednesday, an introverted dachshund who loves to eat and finds moments of happiness in a peaceful garden, joined by friends to create wonderful memories together.”

Beyond enjoying the charming art in a vibrant picnic-like park setting, visitors can look forward to exclusive, specially crafted dishes from five trendsetting eateries, each a standout in its own right. Curated just for this event and proudly endorsed by #GrabThumbsUp, these menus promise exceptional flavours and quality. The featured merchants include:

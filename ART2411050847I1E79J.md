The world is all about artificial intelligence these days and it goes way beyond morphing photographs or creating copy. It’s about the impact of artificial intelligence on the fashion, beauty and creative industries.

At a recent event in Singapore, under the theme “AI & I”, regional experts from Southeast Asia pushed the boundaries of what’s next in fashion, beauty and lifestyle. 

Let’s begin with a material that absorbs carbon dioxide. Yes, you read that right!

**Absorbing CO₂**

Singapore-based company, CozTerra was formed by a group of individuals who optimise the capabilities of artificial intelligence technology to innovate new materials that facilitate CO₂ removal. “We exist to address the world’s most urgent sustainability challenges,” says the company, which took home a prize for innovation last year.

The company has a patent-pending CO₂ removal auxiliaries that are designed for the finishing stages of a textile mill, which merely means that they have created a break-through  solution for textiles. Driven by AI, the company creates materials that can absorb CO₂ when they are exposed to air, providing an ingenious method of reducing pollution. This means that garments created with the textile can be washed and reused as many time as untreated garments, save for them doing their bit to save the plant.

Apart from offering state-of-the-art solutions to combat climate change, CozTerra enabling individuals to become carbon capture agents. A typical T-shirt treated with CozTerra can remove 16g-41g of CO₂ in its lifetime. “We believe that the last piece of the puzzle for every innovation are the human beings that use it. That is you and me,” says the company. 

Though CozTerra joined hands with up-and-coming Singapore designer, Bryan Yeo to a carbon-capturing knit dress. The company has also created cloth tote bags that eliminate CO₂ while on the go. 

**Online fashion** 

Also, at the innovation showcase was ShowStudio's 360° video for Charli XCX, offering a dynamic and interactive journey into fashion and music, using the Apple Visions Pro. Established in November 2000, Showstudio’s projects that have defined the manner in which fashion is presented online. A pioneer in fashion film, it offers a platform to nurture and encourage fashion to engage with moving image in the digital age.

Inspired by the inherent generosity of the verb “to show”, Showstudio opens up the studio of designers and artists, allowing everyone to not only witness the creative process, but to respond and contribute creatively, documenting, communicating and evaluating the results.

AI is rapidly transforming creative industries, becoming embedded in fashion, art and design. Innovation often emerges from the most unexpected partnerships. From fashion designers teaming up with tech innovators to furniture designers collaborating with lifestyle brands, interdisciplinary collaborations are redefining aesthetics and shaping the future of fashion and design.

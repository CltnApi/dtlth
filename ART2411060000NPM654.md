Calls for assembly to draft new charter

The coalition parties have agreed that a constitutional drafting assembly (CDA) should be established and any changes it recommends must genuinely benefit the people, according to the Bhumjaithai (BJT) Party.

Chaichanok Chidchob, the party secretary-general, said charter amendments had been brought up for discussion by coalition partners, with none concerned that the process might not be completed within its term of office.

Mr Chaichanok said that a charter referendum is essential to determine whether changes are needed and to pinpoint the specific issues to address. There would be no opposition if the problematic areas are clearly identified.

A referendum will provide reassurance that the government can proceed with the charter rewrite process, he said, while noting the size of the majority required for a charter referendum to be approved must be discussed and decided by the joint House-Senate committee.

The coalition parties have also agreed that Section 112 of the Criminal Code, or the lese majeste law, should not be revised. He added that an amnesty proposal for political offenders must not extend to those charged with lese majeste.

Chartthaipattana leader Varawut Silpa-archa said yesterday the government would do its best to push for the establishment of a CDA. However, the charter itself may not be completed before the next election in 2027.

He said a CDA would be instrumental in a charter rewrite and would remain independent and inclusive as it must design a new charter that truly caters to all corners of the political map.

He cited the 1997 constitution, known as the "people's charter", which was only completed years later despite a CDA being created solely for the purpose during the Banharn Silpa-archa government.

Mr Varawut agreed that the charter rewrite process must not be rushed so that no loopholes or flaws in the constitution are created due to the process being hurried.

Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said yesterday she would be happy to meet with People's Party (PP) list MP Parit Wacharasindhu to discuss the charter rewrite process.

Last week, Mr Parit said he wished to discuss ways to speed up the process with the prime minister so that the country can have a new constitution up and running before the next poll.

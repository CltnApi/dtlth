Vacheron Constantin and Enter Projects Asia present “PROJECT RATTAN – FROM GEOMETRY TO ARTISTRY”, an artistic collaboration with Thai rattan artisans at the Vacheron Constantin Siam Paragon Boutique, Bangkok. Aligned with Vacheron Constantin’s annual theme, “From Geometry to Artistry”, the project features a collection of artisanal sculptures adorning the boutique ceiling and window display, showcasing the art of rattan weaving shaped into geometric forms, pioneering a new level of tactile and immersive retail experience. Staying true to its motto, "Do better if possible, and that is always possible."

This partnership heralds a bold evolution in watchmaking and retail, merging design, art, and craftsmanship with innovative techniques, creating a unique experience at Vacheron Constantin’s boutique in the heart of Bangkok, within the iconic Siam Paragon.

**Rattan Artwork** 

Rattan is a natural material found abundantly in Thailand’s forests, traditionally used for weaving and crafting household items and furniture since ancient times. “Transitions” and “Connections” are key elements of the rattan artwork seamlessly integrated into the art pieces. Each weave tells a story, a testament to artisans whose skills have been passed down through five generations. Enhanced by varied natural colouring techniques, selected rattan strands are transformed into remarkable works of art. The installation’s organic form contrasts with the boutique’s decoration, inviting visitors to engage and explore. 

The rattan weaving process and design draw inspiration from the art of guilloché, an intricate engraving technique. Vacheron Constantin’s master guillocheur notes, “Line-by-line guilloché patterns require great concentration, regularity, and precision. The creative process remains empirical, stemming from a blend of expertise and creativity.” Visitors can also view three guilloché dials created by the Maison’s Master Guillocheur up close.

**From Geometry to Artistry: Vacheron Constantin’s Annual Theme** 

Transforming mechanical instruments into art and design objects is integral to Vacheron Constantin’s vision. A sketch, a geometrical design, and its technical extensions give rise to a world of shapes, colours, and textures unique to the Maison and its aesthetic values. 

Far from being self-sufficient, the technical demands of a Vacheron Constantin timepiece inspire aesthetic exploration that transcends functionality. Beyond function, “form” expresses the creative synergy uniting artisans, designers, finishers, dial-makers, and leather artisans in crafting a single timepiece. The quest for precision, rigorous execution, and harmonious balance—all essential skills in creating watch movements—serve a broader purpose, ensuring each timepiece becomes a vessel for emotion. For the Maison, watchmaking “geometry” becomes an artistic domain, transforming time measurement into an object of contemplation.

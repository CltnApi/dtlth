Mars, Incorporated, a global leader in pet care products and services, confectionery, snacking, and food, and the maker of some of the world’s most-loved brands, proudly announces the 25th anniversary of its Mars Petcare Pak Chong factory, the manufacturer of PEDIGREE®, WHISKAS®, IAMS®, CESAR®, SHEBA®, TEMPTATIONS™, NUTRO™, KAL KAN®, OPTIMUM™, and KITE KAT®. This significant milestone marks a journey of growth and innovation, establishing the Pak Chong factory as the largest Mars facility in Asia.

Established in 1999 as Mars Petcare Thailand’s first pet food manufacturing facility, the Pak Chong factory has since expanded its operations to meet the growing demands of pet parents both locally and globally. Today, the factory employs over 1,400 associates and indirectly supports the community’s economic growth by creating jobs. As a result, the facility now serves 36 countries and contributes a significant share of Thailand’s pet food exports.

Mr. Teeradej Kasisareewong, Interim Manufacturing Director of Mars Pet Nutrition, Southeast Asia, remarked, “We take pride in pioneering the pet food industry in Thailand 25 years ago. Our technologies and capabilities have evolved exponentially, allowing us to produce a versatile range of products—from dry pet food and wet single-serve options to specialised dental care, as well as functional and positive treats for cats and dogs.”

Over its 25-year history, Mars has made significant investments to increase capacity and capabilities to meet the evolving needs of pet parents. After initial production began in 1999, a pouch facility was added in 2002, followed by a care and treats facility in 2003, and a state-of-the-art positive treats facility in 2021. Today, the Pak Chong facility proudly manufactures products in 65 different packaging formats.

In recognition of its commitment to safety, the Pak Chong factory was recently awarded the Silver Prize in the Zero Accident Award from the Thailand Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, underscoring its dedication to fostering a safe and thriving workplace. Furthermore, Mars Petcare Thailand remains committed to sustainability, with initiatives aimed at minimising environmental impact, including efforts towards zero waste to landfill and a transition to renewable energy sources.

“This milestone reflects our operational success and a strong culture of quality, safety, innovation, and sustainability. As we celebrate our 25-year history, we reaffirm our commitment to growth, development, and upholding the Mars Five Principles in all our endeavours,” added Mr. Teeradej.

Congratulating Mars Pet Nutrition on this occasion, Mr. Somkiat Wiriyakulnan, Deputy Governor of Nakorn Ratchasima Province, said, “I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Mars for reaching this significant milestone. For the past 25 years, the Pak Chong factory has been a cornerstone of our community, creating jobs and supporting local economic development. We are deeply grateful for Mars’ continued commitment to the Pak Chong community.”

Mr. Narit Therdsteerasukdi, Secretary-General of the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI), represented at the event by Mr. Wirat Tatsaringkansakul, Deputy Secretary-General, also shared his thoughts, stating, “Mars’ long-standing investment in Thailand reflects our country’s attractiveness as a destination for high-quality manufacturing. The success of the Pak Chong factory showcases the potential for global companies to thrive here, contributing to our economy and enhancing Thailand’s position as a key player in the global pet food industry. We look forward to continued collaboration and future development.”

Rohit Jindal, General Manager of Mars Pet Nutrition Southeast Asia, added, “According to the Mars Pet Parent Study, one in three pet parents globally, including in Thailand, considers their pet the single most important thing in their life. At Mars Pet Nutrition, we touch the lives of over 400 million pet parents worldwide. This celebration marks not only 25 years of operational excellence but also our commitment to our Purpose: A Better World for Pets.”

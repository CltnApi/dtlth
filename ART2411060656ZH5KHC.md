Materials, objects, found items -- Prach Pimarnman's art is based on the strict conceptualisation of those elements. Raised in Narathiwat, with a family both in Bangkok and the southern province, Prach has investigated Deep South questions conditioned by a fraught, unsettling history and its contemporary aftermath. His works are grounded in the subtlety of texture -- teacups, cement, barbed wire, quilts sewn by local housewives -- and invites reflections on more than one level.

Prach's new solo show "From Nomad To Nowhere", on view at Warin Lab on Charoen Krung 36, builds on his interest and develops a wider range of implications. The works on show are a set of sculpture-paintings with uneven, patterned texture, in brick-red, milky white, evocative brown and charred black. They're abstract and shapeless at first glance, but assuming vague outlines and forms upon closer inspection. These are works that invite you to keep looking, closely.

These are sublime geo-paintings -- a satellite's eye view of a landscape as seen from the sky, or from space, a la Google Map. The location is Narathiwat, Prach's home, where he reassigns the surveillance-worthy, top-view angle of an area to become a contemplation on urban expansion, aggressive land reclamation and capitalist intervention. Once a neighbourhood of fishermen, the Bang Nara River delta has been "claimed" by investors, while a nearby mountain has been mined for rocks, thus altering the environmental make-up, shrinking the waterway and undermining local livelihoods.

Fishermen who have been living there for decades are facing growing pressure from "landlords", Prach says. Narathiwat is often listed as one of the poorest provinces in Thailand, and yet the mechanism that perpetuates such dismal statistics is also making someone rich as well.

Prach is one of the visual artists from the Muslim Deep South who pushes the specific issues of his hometown to the gallery scene. The themes of identity, Malay connection and violence have featured in his works. His previous show, "San Saeb" at SAC Gallery, looked at the largely forgotten history of Malay captives from Pattani during the early Rattanakosin period; while "Orang Siyae Oghae Nayu" ponders his own "insider-outsider" identity as a Bangkok-born "nayu" of Narathiwat.

"From Nomad To Nowhere" sees Prach stretch his focus beyond the headline topics automatically associated with the Deep South -- the question of identity politics, violence, or obvious themes such as belonging and home -- and into ecological and developmental concerns. The politics of the southernmost provinces sometimes mask the ground-level fact that fishermen are struggling to keep going, and we need a view from the top to see what's happening on the ground.

Prach Pimarnman’s new works for ‘From Nomad To Nowhere’.

The use of material and texture is inherent to the concept. Prach collected bricks from ruined buildings in Narathiwat and ground them for red-brown powder. The white came from local clay; the black from local charcoal; the yellow from sand. The work displays a dimensional arrangement through a grid-like pattern produced by fishing nets and meshwork from chicken coops -- these materials apply fine layers and a sense of something being imprisoned. They work best when you step closer to the paintings and spend time pondering their details.

Upstairs from the main gallery, a 20-minute video puts things in perspective. The video, soundtracked to the melodious, Malay-inflected _likay hulu_, is a semi-experimental, non-narrative sketch of the Narathiwat eco-landscape. No explanation is given, or not much. However, an image of a shimmering, crystalline sand succeeded by a shot of a sand dredger humming in Bang Nara River speaks of the forces at work. The human voice we hear in the video is that of a Muslim-Chinese fisherman, explaining his background and the hard life dealt by both economic and environmental pressures.

"From Nomad To Nowhere" shows Prach as an increasingly mature artist working not only from a personal vantage point, but also from intensive research and a finely-tuned process of creation. We'll be looking forward to his next show.

She will also meet with business leaders and the Thai community in Los Angeles at the Thai temple. The Thai community in the US, which numbers more than 400,000, is the largest overseas. The PM will also hold discussions with the US private sector to build networks, including a reception with the Motion Picture Association (MPA), featuring senior executives from major US film companies.

“The meeting with leading US filmmakers is expected to promote film production in various tourist destinations in Thailand, with revenue projected to exceed 4 billion baht this year. The Thai government is ready to support and streamline processes for filming in Thailand,” said government spokesperson Jirayu Huangsap.

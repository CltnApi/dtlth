**Bread & Roses**

Premieres on Nov 22

A documentary that follows various women as they fight to maintain their autonomy in the wake of Kabul’s fall to the Taliban in 2021. After decades of war in Afghanistan, the Taliban’s hold grew stronger as American forces left the country. As a result, women lost numerous freedoms, including the right to an education beyond the sixth grade, the ability to work, and the right to walk unaccompanied in public. Without men, women are now essentially unseen. The documentary speaks to the larger issues unfolding throughout the country by focusing on three specific women whose world completely shifts as a result of the Taliban’s authoritarian control.

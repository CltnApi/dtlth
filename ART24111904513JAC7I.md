Dow, a global leader in materials science and silicone production, is at the forefront of advancing cutting-edge material technology solutions to drive the sustainable development of the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) sector in Southeast Asia. This investment in innovation is not just a strategic move but also a commitment to shaping a greener and more sustainable mobility future. 

The new energy vehicle industry in Southeast Asia has surged significantly in recent years, with Chinese brands swiftly penetrating the market. Data from automotive industry research institutions indicates that by May 2024, prominent Chinese new energy vehicle brands had established a presence, invested in factories, or commenced production in Southeast Asia. Thailand has emerged as the top destination for these ventures, followed by Malaysia and Indonesia. This development aligns with Thailand’s formation of the National Electric Vehicle Policy Committee (NEVPC) in 2020, which outlined an ambitious vision for 2035. The plan emphasises the development of zero-emission vehicles, next-generation automotive technologies, and innovative business models to establish a comprehensive EV industry chain. 

Against this evolving mobility landscape, Dow, with over 120 years of expertise in materials science, plays a crucial role in continuously innovating material technology solutions to support the next generation of mobility. These innovations help original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) overcome challenges in safety, interactivity, and electrification, fostering the sustainable development of vehicles. Dow is forging close partnerships with automakers and end-users alike to accelerate the innovation cycle of product technologies. This collaboration aims to meet the distinctive requirements and rapid expansion of diverse regional markets. 

Dow offers thermal management and protection solutions that safeguard Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and battery systems, as well as support for ultra-fast charging at stations. Products such as silicone synthetic leather and self-sealing silicone for tyres further contribute to the sustainable development and innovation of motor vehicles. 

Strengthening ADAS Component Performance As consumer demand for automotive safety and intelligence grows, the adoption of ADAS is on the rise, with manufacturers setting higher benchmarks for linearity, sensitivity, repeatability, quick response, resolution, and stability in the assembly process. The choice of materials directly impacts the reliability of ADAS products, and Dow offers a diverse range of DOWSIL™ thermal management products with varying thermal conductivity levels. 

In addition to thermal management, Dow provides high-performance silicone solutions for electromagnetic shielding, reliable sealing, and specialised protection for ADAS. These solutions help customers address the challenges of designing next-generation sensor systems in a cost-effective and efficient manner. 

Creating a Safety Shield for Batteries Safety concerns, such as thermal runaway incidents in EV batteries, remain critical. Dow's DOWSIL™ advanced silicone materials are designed for battery fire protection, offering robust thermal stability and low flammability. These materials are tailored to enhance the durability and lifespan of various battery module types and configurations. 

Dow also provides a comprehensive suite of materials, simulation environments, and application scenario testing methods to support battery manufacturers and OEMs in selecting the right materials and optimising battery performance. 

Driving Innovation in Supercharging Technology New energy vehicle consumers are increasingly concerned about range anxiety, while advancements in battery manufacturing technology aim to extend vehicle range. However, the current charging process presents challenges, such as extended charging times and insufficient infrastructure, leading to the rise of supercharging solutions. 

Upgrading charging stations is critical, requiring high-power outputs, rapid cooling, and robust durability. Dow is exploring performance advancements of silicones in thermal conductivity, sealing, insulation, and flame retardancy. Dow focuses on three key areas in the charging facilities domain: thermal management, protection and assembly, and insulation and thermal conductivity. The company offers a wide range of DOWSIL™ products to address these challenges. 

Achieving "Sustainable Development" Through Innovation Dow is committed to transforming "sustainable development" into a tangible business reality through continuous innovation and steadfast efforts. It has pioneered solutions in silicone synthetic leather and self-sealing silicone for tyres. 

LuxSense™ silicone synthetic leather is the world's premier high-end material approved for diverse applications, including vehicle seats and interiors. It offers a soft, easy-to-clean texture, neutral scent, robust durability, and a low-carbon, environmentally friendly footprint. 

SILASTIC™ self-sealing silicone for tyres is an internationally pioneering solution that creates a self-sealing layer on the inner surface of tyres. When punctured, the tyre seals swiftly, preserving normal performance. This innovative solution promotes de-leatherisation, reduces carbon emissions, and supports sustainable manufacturing processes. 

In conclusion, Dow has introduced comprehensive solutions to reduce carbon emissions at every stage of the vehicle lifecycle, from design and development to production, usage, and recycling. Over 80% of Dow's R&D projects focus on climate protection, circular economy initiatives, and safer materials development. The company aims to reduce annual net carbon emissions by 5 million tonnes by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

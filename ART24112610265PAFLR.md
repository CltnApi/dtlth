The National Vaccine Institute (NVI) recently organised the **11th National Vaccine Conference** under the theme “Vaccines in a Borderless World” from **November 13-15, 2024,** at **The Berkeley Hotel Pratunam** in Bangkok. The conference aimed to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experiences among various organisations, including public and private sectors, as well as domestic and international partners. It also served as a platform to disseminate advancements in vaccine science, policies, and strategies encompassing research and development, production, quality assurance and control, and vaccine management for enhancing immunisation programs.

**Special Lecture on Thailand’s Readiness for Disease Outbreaks**

A key highlight of the event was a special lecture titled “Thailand’s Readiness to Tackle Emerging and Re-emerging Diseases” delivered by **Clinical Professor Emeritus Piyasakol Sakolsatayadorn**, President of Mahidol University Council and former Minister of Public Health. The lecture reflected on critical lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, showcasing how these insights have contributed to strengthening Thailand’s public health infrastructure to combat future outbreaks.

Professor Piyasakol emphasised the importance of a comprehensive long-term plan, including bolstering vaccine security and research and development capabilities. Notably, he underscored the implementation of a **100-day action** **plan** aimed at accelerating the development of new vaccines in response to emerging diseases.

**Thailand’s Robust Vaccine Infrastructure**

The lecture also highlighted Thailand’s unprecedented readiness with an integrated infrastructure to support vaccine development and production. This includes:

*   Vaccine research centres equipped with advanced laboratories,
*   Animal testing facilities for preclinical studies,
*   Semi-industrial-scale vaccine manufacturing plants,
*   Clinical research centres,
*   Regulatory bodies, and
*   Investments in human resource development for academic institutions, research organisations, and vaccine manufacturers.

**The Importance of Collaboration**

In closing, Professor Piyasakol stressed that vaccine research and development is a collaborative effort requiring support from multiple sectors, including government agencies, private organisations, and international networks. He reiterated that successful vaccine development—from initial research to final production—depends on seamless cooperation among all stakeholders.

He also highlighted the critical role of international collaboration in ensuring long-term health security, emphasising that global partnerships are essential to address shared health challenges effectively.

The 11th National Vaccine Conference successfully reaffirmed Thailand’s commitment to advancing vaccine development and preparedness for emerging public health threats while fostering a spirit of collaboration both nationally and internationally.

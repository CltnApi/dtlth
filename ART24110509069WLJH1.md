ONE Championship featuring unsigned fighters on ONE 170 part of ‘Rocky’ theme for Russell Crowe tie-in

ONE Championship will feature unsigned fighters at January’s ONE 170 extravaganza as part of a “Rocky” theme to tie in with Russell Crowe’s upcoming MMA film.

“The Beast In Me” will shoot scenes at Impact Arena on January 24, and throughout fight week in Bangkok. The film’s plot centres on an MMA fighter, coached by Crowe’s character, coming out of retirement in ONE to avenge his brother, who suffered an illegal blow in the promotion.

Two blockbuster Muay Thai title fights have already been announced for the card, pitting featherweight champ TawanchaI PK Saenchai against Superbon, and Superlek Kiatmoo9 against Nico Carrillo. 

But a catchweight bout between Thailand’s Suriyanlek Por Yenying and Myanmar’s Thant Zin was officially added to the card on Wednesday, piquing interest given both are unsigned fighters competing on ONE Friday Fights events at Lumpinee Stadium.

“We wanted to feature a ‘Rocky’ theme, like the movie, ‘Rocky 1’,” ONE CEO Chatri Sityodtong told the Bangkok Post, citing Sylvester Stallone’s famed tale of an underdog boxer which won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1977.

“We wanted to give \[fighters\] a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to shine on the world’s biggest stage of martial arts,” the Asia-based martial arts organisation’s chairman added.

Myanmar’s Zin recently came up short in a second-round TKO defeat by Takeru Segawa, in which he threatened a seismic upset by knocking down the Japanese superstar kickboxer. 

Suriyanlek, meanwhile, has six wins – five by knockout – on ONE Friday Fights, earning eight 350,000 baht performance bonuses from his nine fights.

Neither has yet secured a US$100,000 ONE Championship contract and a call-up to the main roster Fight Night and numbered events, however

But ONE is making an exception for its big return to Impact Arena.

A statement said the promotion is “ready to give ONE Lumpinee athletes who have not signed a contract yet the opportunity to demonstrate their potential”.

“ONE 170 will be more special than ever,” the statement added. “This is the first time ONE will give rising star athletes from ONE Lumpinee an opportunity to show their skills on a major historical event broadcast around the world, in order to continue their dream of winning the ONE contract.”

January’s ONE 170 card also features a catchweight Muay Thai bout between the legendary Seksan Or Kwanmuang, and Myanmar lethwei icon Soe Lin Oo – both of whom came through the ONE Lumpinee ecosystem.

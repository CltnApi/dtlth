He will be joined by news anchor Sararat "Elle" Rattanasuwan. The programme airs every Sunday from 10.30pm to 11pm.

Additionally, Nation TV has launched another programme, "Nation Watch", which airs Monday through Friday from 1.40pm to 2.15pm, focusing on alerting the public to various dangers. The programme includes a segment called "Nation Ready to Help", which acts as a platform for the public to report their problems needing support.

This segment addresses issues related to legal matters, various threats, or damages resulting from public services. Once a complaint is received, "Nation Ready to Help" coordinates with relevant agencies to provide necessary support.

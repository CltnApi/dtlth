A Commitment to Sustainability and Purpose 
-------------------------------------------

L’Oréal’s commitment to sustainable growth is a defining feature of its corporate strategy, not just in Thailand but across the globe. For nearly two decades, L'Oréal has transformed itself into a socially and environmentally responsible company, setting science-based targets that respect the “Planetary Boundaries” to ensure its operations have a minimal impact on the environment. This dedication is evidenced in its purpose-driven initiatives, which encourage all its brands to contribute to society through responsible and sustainable practices. From the beginning to the end of its product lifecycle, L'Oréal actively seeks to reduce its environmental footprint while ensuring that the beauty industry continues to evolve sustainably. 

Social Impact and Inclusion: A People-First Approach 
-----------------------------------------------------

L'Oréal’s emphasis on people extends to diverse and inclusive hiring practices, promoting a workplace where everyone feels valued, respected, and empowered. The company views diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) as essential to driving innovation, creativity, and business success. Globally, L'Oréal is recognised for its initiatives that empower vulnerable groups, including women, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. Furthermore, the company actively promotes opportunities for the younger generation, providing more than 25,000 professional opportunities for individuals under 30 annually. This commitment is reflected in its workforce of over 13,000 employees aged 50 and above, illustrating L'Oréal’s dedication to intergenerational inclusion.

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion: L'Oréal's Core Values 
-----------------------------------------------------

L'Oréal Thailand exemplifies L'Oréal’s global DE&I principles through a variety of local initiatives. The company strives to foster a working environment that celebrates cultural diversity and reflects the diversity of its consumer base. To promote inclusivity, L'Oréal provides unconscious bias training and leadership programs that encourage openness. In addition, employee support groups focusing on various aspects of diversity—including gender, race, and LGBTQ+ identity—promote understanding and solidarity among employees. These initiatives aim to create a corporate culture where people from all backgrounds feel empowered to express themselves fully and contribute to the company’s success. 

Supporting LGBTQIA+ and Promoting Gender Equality 
--------------------------------------------------

L'Oréal’s dedication to gender equality and LGBTQIA+ inclusion extends beyond words to concrete actions. In Thailand, the company ensures that all its policies support equality, allowing employees to choose not to disclose their gender on application forms and to be evaluated solely on their skills and qualifications. The company has expanded its employee benefits to include same-sex couples, adjusting paternity leave to a more inclusive “Secondary Parental Leave,” and offering primary parental leave for adoption by same-sex couples. Through these initiatives, L'Oréal champions inclusivity and recognises the rights and needs of all its employees. 

The brand Kiehl’s, under the L'Oréal umbrella, reinforces this commitment with the recently launched "Open Doors" program, which has a long-standing tradition of supporting LGBTQIA+ youth and fostering a spirit of inclusivity. This initiative offers young people equal opportunities to build essential skills and instills pride in their identities. 

L'Oréal For Youth: Empowering the Next Generation 
--------------------------------------------------

L'Oréal’s global initiative, “L'Oréal For Youth,” is dedicated to providing equal opportunities for young people across the world, supporting them with the skills and experiences necessary to bridge the gap between education and employment. This program assists youth from all backgrounds in developing both hard and soft skills, preparing them for successful careers. In 2023, L'Oréal For Youth reached over 100,000 young individuals worldwide, helping them gain valuable knowledge through coaching, mentorship, and skill-building workshops. The program also organises events such as business case competitions and strategy contests to engage youth in practical problem-solving exercises, further fostering their career readiness. 

L'Oréal's Commitment to All Generations 
----------------------------------------

With a workforce that includes individuals from four different generations, L'Oréal recognises the importance of adapting its policies to support employees at every stage of life. L'Oréal For All Generations, an initiative that originated in Spain, has expanded globally, offering wellness programs, lifelong learning, and career development for all ages. Generation Days, launched in France, China, and the United States, bring employees of different ages together to learn from each other, fostering collaboration and mutual respect across generations. In response to an aging global workforce, L'Oréal's commitment to intergenerational inclusion ensures that employees over 50 are valued and empowered to continue contributing to the company’s growth. 

DE&I Initiatives in Thailand 
-----------------------------

L'Oréal Thailand champions a diverse and inclusive workplace, embedding DE&I principles into recruitment for a fair and equitable process. Gender-blind applications ensure evaluations focus solely on merit. Inclusive policies extend to same-sex partners, supporting rights like secondary parental leave, with further advancements anticipated upon legal recognition of marriage equality. Additionally, L'Oréal Thailand offers a flex leave program, providing all employees with 15 days beyond their annual leave to address any personal needs, regardless of family status and genders, further enhancing well-being and flexibility. 

Creating a More Inclusive and Sustainable Future 
-------------------------------------------------

L'Oréal Groupe in Thailand represents a company that not only leads in beauty innovation but also sets an example in social responsibility and inclusivity. The Group’s dedication to sustainability, diversity, and employee empowerment underscores its commitment to being a beauty company that moves the world forward. By fostering a culture where everyone feels valued and empowered, L'Oréal continues to build a brighter and more inclusive future for employees, consumers, and partners alike.

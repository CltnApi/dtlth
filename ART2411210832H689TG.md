TCMA Advocates Sustainable Waste Management with Cement Kiln Technology

The Thai Cement Manufacturers Association (TCMA) is driving innovation in sustainable waste management by championing the co-processing of waste in cement kilns. This advanced method ensures safe waste disposal, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and minimises landfill impact, aligning with the Zero Emission Concept. 

At the opening of EnwastExpo 2024, Industry Minister Akanat Promphan presided over the event, where TCMA Vice-Chairman Mr. Nopadol Ramyarupa highlighted the critical need to address waste challenges across Thailand's agricultural, industrial, and community sectors. Effective waste sorting and upstream handling, he noted, are vital to reducing environmental impacts and optimising resource use. 

Member cement manufacturers within TCMA integrate waste as alternative raw materials (AR) and alternative fuel (AF) in the cement production process. This process transforms industrial waste from one sector into resources for another, reinforcing the cement industry’s role in creating circular economies. 

Using advanced technology, co-processing in cement kilns operates at temperatures exceeding 1,450 degrees Celsius, allowing safe and pollution-free disposal of waste while eliminating landfill and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2022, these efforts converted 23% of waste into alternative fuel, cutting 4.7 million tons of CO2 emissions. TCMA aims to achieve a target of 68% alternative fuel usage by 2030. 

The cement industry remains a vital driver of Thailand's economy and a pioneer in waste management innovation. By uniting government, industry, and community stakeholders, TCMA’s co-processing initiative is setting a new benchmark for sustainable waste management practices, fostering collaboration to create a cleaner, greener future for Thailand.

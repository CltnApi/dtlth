Central shopping centres are hosting grand year-end mega-events. These include 40 uniquely designed Christmas trees across regions in Thailand aiming to attract both Thai shoppers and international tourists. The initiative seeks to position Thailand as a world-class destination for global festivities.

At CentralWorld, the highlight is a 40-metre Art Toy-themed Christmas tree, the tallest in Southeast Asia. This collaboration features 11 artists who have created 23 unique characters, with 56 art toys displayed throughout the mall in a special Xmas Edition theme.

Additionally, a Merry Ville village with 12 zones brings the festive charm of a European Christmas market, running from now until January 5, 2025.

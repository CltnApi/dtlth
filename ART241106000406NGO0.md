Thai League 1 champions Buriram United clash with J-League giants Yokohama F Marinos in a crucial away fixture of the AFC Champions League Elite at International Stadium Yokohama today.

Buriram will head into the tie with the record of being the last Thai team to have beaten a Japanese side on the continental stage -- a 2-0 win against Cerezo Osaka in 2018.

The Thunder Castle are unbeaten in their last three games on the road and an added lure for them is that victory could see them topping the standings at the end of the fourth game.

Marinos will be determined to bring down high-flying Buriram as the Japanese club trail the Thai champions by three points.

Denied victory by a late Shandong Taishan equaliser in the third game, Marinos will bank on their impressive home record to stop Buriram.

Meanwhile, another Thai League 1 side, Bangkok United, will be out to further tighten their grip on the Group G top spot when they welcome Hong Kong's Lee Man at the Thammasat Stadium in the AFC Champions League Two today.

Bangkok United won the away clash 1-0 and will be confident that home ground advantage will help them secure another three points.

Rabbits drop points
-------------------

BG Pathum United could only manage a 2-2 draw against Lamphun Warriors, who hosted the game in Chiang Mai on Monday night.

The Rabbits remained in fourth place with 19 points from 11 matches. Bangkok United lead the standings with 27 points.

AFC role for Nualphan
---------------------

The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has confirmed Football Association of Thailand (FAT) president Nualphan Lamsam's appointment to its AFC Associations Committee.

In a letter to the FAT yesterday, the AFC also confirmed that Pairit Tanpairee will hold a place in the AFC Competition Committee and Pisutha Nantaworawet will serve on its Women's Football Committee.

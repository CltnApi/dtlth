LIXIL's Vision 2050: Pioneering Zero Carbon and Circular Living

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/184c44a7-17d2-417e-9958-9ced9e5b4855)

**The environment and sustainability** are pressing global issues, encompassing climate change-related risks such as heatwaves, torrential rains, and rising sea levels. In 2015, the world united under the **Paris Agreement**, pledging to limit the global temperature rise to below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The **Glasgow Climate Pact** of 2021 underscored that this figure is not merely aspirational but a critical global goal.

To achieve this, the international community must reduce CO₂ and other greenhouse gas emissions by **45% by 2030** (compared to 2010 levels) and reach net zero by **2050**. The building construction and materials industries account for **19% of direct CO****₂** emissions, with another **18%** attributed to indirect emissions from buildings and homes in use.\*¹ 

In 2019, **LIXIL** launched its **Environmental Vision 2050**, committing to "Zero Carbon and Circular Living." As a global leader in water and housing solutions, LIXIL focuses on three key areas: **Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation****,** **Water Sustainability****,** and the **Circular Economy**. 

To achieve its long-term vision (10–30 years) and medium-term **Science-Based Targets (SBTs)** (3–10 years), LIXIL embeds environmental strategy into its business as a core initiative. This goes beyond corporate responsibility to minimising environmental impact, aiming instead to create positive change through collaboration with stakeholders and industry partners. 

In Thailand, **LIXIL** aims to lead environmental sustainability by reducing Scope 1, 2, and 3 CO₂ emissions to net zero. Its commitment extends to sustainable water use and resource management, ensuring a better future for generations to come.

**Wiwat Surapatananon**, Leader of LIXIL Water Technology Thailand, commented: “The property sector plays a vital role in addressing environmental sustainability. LIXIL works closely with global and local partners to provide eco-friendly solutions that inspire architects and designers to prioritise environmental considerations in building specifications. We also address builders' and developers' needs for meeting green building standards, including LEED certification, through proven eco-friendly products that reduce water and energy use.”

**American Standard e-Lite Shower Toilet** 

Wiwat added, “For homeowners, navigating options can be overwhelming. We simplify this with informed product choices that improve daily life and minimise environmental impact. For example, the **American Standard e-Lite Shower Toilet** reduces water consumption by up to **20%**, helping conserve water and energy while enhancing user experience and well-being.” 

**Achieving the Vision: Key Focus Areas** 

**Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation** 

LIXIL strives for net-zero CO₂ emissions by **2050** by reducing the environmental impact of its operations and products while supporting societal decarbonisation. Recognised by the **Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi)** in March 2024, LIXIL became the first Japanese building materials company to secure approval for its **2050 Zero CO****₂** **Emissions Target**. 

LIXIL invites collaboration across the Thai property sector—from architects to developers—to differentiate projects and meet **green building certifications** aligned with Thailand’s national net-zero ambitions. 

**Water Sustainability** 

As a leader in water technology, LIXIL drives global water conservation through efficient manufacturing processes and water-saving innovations. 

*   The **American Standard Acacia Supasleek Collection** reduces water use by up to **49%**.
*   **ClickMove™** **Technology** in faucets achieves **40% water savings** through precise volume control. 

These innovations demonstrate LIXIL’s commitment to responsible water use and sustainability for future generations.

**Circular Economy** 

LIXIL actively promotes resource sustainability through initiatives that span the entire product lifecycle—from procurement to disposal. Its circular manufacturing model incorporates recycled materials and designs products for reuse. 

Guided by the **LIXIL Plastics Action Statement**, the company reduces and reuses plastics while developing alternatives. For instance, the **GROHE Cradle-to-Cradle™** products prioritise recyclability and minimal environmental impact, earning **LEED Gold certification**, a global standard for green building. 

By addressing climate change, promoting water sustainability, and advancing the circular economy, **LIXIL** leads the way in fostering sustainable development for communities worldwide.

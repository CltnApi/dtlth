Migrants risk losing right to work, stay

Many employers and migrant workers have complained about problems tied to the new registration and work permit renewal requirements, which have reportedly led to large numbers of migrant workers missing the deadline and losing their legal status.

Nilubol Pongpayom, a representative of Nai Chang Si Khao (White Employers), said yesterday that the employer group previously petitioned the government through the Prime Minister's Office to revise the requirements to make migrant registration and work permit renewal more convenient.

However, it has yet to receive any response while hundreds of thousands of migrant labourers have missed the Oct 31 deadline and become illegal workers, Ms Nilubol said.

She said the Certificate of Identity (CI), an extra document required for migrant worker registration -- the first step before they can apply for a work permit renewal -- was way too complicated, and there are only seven CI centres nationwide.

She blamed state officials' allegedly poor supervision of these centres for the unfair treatment many employers and migrant workers claim to have been subjected to.

The CI centre in Samut Prakan, for instance, demanded migrant workers pay a CI fee of between 3,800 and 4,000 baht without issuing them a proper receipt, Ms Nilubol said.

"The process was rather complicated and involved multiple fees," she said.

Due to there only being seven CI centres, many migrant workers had to travel to faraway provinces, she said.

Another batch of migrant workers whose work permits are due to expire on Feb 13 will have to travel back to their country of origin and start the process all over again before they can be registered to resume working in Thailand, Ms Nilubol added.

A 30-year-old worker from Myanmar who asked not to be named said she had worked legally for a large company in Samut Sakhon and consistently paid her taxes for years.

The complications related to the new CI requirement caused her to miss a deadline on Oct 1, so she now ranks as an illegal migrant worker, the woman said.

"I have been living and working here, paid all my taxes and have social security. But this complicated process made me miss the deadline and lose my legal status," she said.

A 28-year-old man from Myanmar whose work permit is due to expire on Feb 13 said he was loath to return to his home country where he would end up funding the ruling junta as a taxpayer.

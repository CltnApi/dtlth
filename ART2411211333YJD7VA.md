Highway upgrade improves Bangkok-East travel

A section of **Highway 3481**, linking Bangkok to eastern provinces such as Chachoengsao and Prachin Buri, has been expanded to four traffic lanes from two, improving transport between the capital and the East.

The upgrade carried out by the Department of Highways will improve transport in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), deputy government spokesperson Sasikarn Watthanachan said on Thursday.

Specifically, an 11.8-kilometre section in Prachin Buri from Ban Hua Pai village to Prachin Buri Community Housing now boasts four lanes, significantly enhancing traffic flow.

Ms Sasikarn said the expansion was essential for handling increased traffic volumes and ensuring safer, more efficient transport in the eastern region.

Raised medians, concrete median barriers, new lighting and traffic signals are also expected to be welcomed by local commuters and regional logistics operators.

In related news, the government says it is working to resolve delays in the high-speed rail project linking three airports — Don Mueang, Suvarnabhumi and U-tapao — which is [five years behind schedule](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2893058/three-airport-rail-plan-hits-another-snag).

The project, also seen as a key piece of infrastructure for the EEC, is expected to receive final approval from the cabinet by the end of this year.

Construction is set to begin early next year, with operations to start in 2029 or 2030 at the earliest.

The original contract with the Asia Era One consortium led by the Charoen Pokphand Group was signed in 2019 but the Covid-19 pandemic meant little progress was made for the next three years.

The contract is now undergoing revisions, including new payment structures for the public investment share and a revenue-sharing model.

As a result, the revised contract will first have to be reviewed by the Office of the Attorney General. The review is expected to take no longer than 30 days.

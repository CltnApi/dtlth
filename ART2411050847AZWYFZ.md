Quincy Jones, the man known simply as "Q," was a huge influence on American music in his work with artists ranging from Count Basie to Frank Sinatra and reshaped pop music in his collaborations with Michael Jackson.

Jones died on Sunday at the age of 91, his publicist said.

There was very little Jones did not do in a music career of more than 65 years. He was a trumpeter, bandleader, arranger, composer, producer and winner of 27 Grammy Awards.

A studio workaholic and a virtuoso at handling delicate egos, he shaped recordings by jazz greats such as Miles Davis, produced Sinatra, and put together the superstar ensemble that recorded the 1985 fund-raiser _We Are the World_, the biggest hit song of its time.

Jones also was a prolific writer of movie scores and co-produced the film _The Color Purple_, as well as the 1990s television show _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_, which launched the career of Will Smith.

Jones' circle of friends included some of the best known figures of the 20th century. He dined with Pablo Picasso, met Pope John Paul II, helped Nelson Mandela celebrate his 90th birthday and once retreated to Marlon Brando's South Pacific island to recover from a breakdown.

Everything he did was stamped with his universal and undeniable hipness. U2 frontman Bono called Jones "the coolest person I've ever met".

Jones' most lasting achievements were in collaboration with Jackson. They made three landmark albums - _Off the Wall_ in 1979, _Thriller_ in 1982, and _Bad_ in 1987 - that changed the landscape of American popular music. _Thriller_ sold as many as 70 million copies, with six of the nine songs on the album becoming top 10 singles.

**Musical break-in**

Quincy Delight Jones Jr. was born March 14, 1933, in Chicago. As a boy, he aspired to be a gangster like those he saw in his rough neighbourhood. He was 7 when his mother was taken to a mental institution. His father, a carpenter, remarried and moved the family to Bremerton in Washington state, where young Quincy pursued a life of petty crime.

Jones said his interest in music bloomed in Bremerton, when he and some friends found a piano after sneaking into the community centre in the segregated wartime housing project where they lived.

He experimented with different instruments in the school band before settling on the trumpet and by 13 was playing jazz, popular music and rhythm-and-blues in nightclubs. In Seattle at age 14, Jones met 16-year-old Ray Charles, not yet famous, who taught him to arrange and compose music.

Basie and trumpeter Clark Terry also would be mentors to the young Jones and he won a scholarship to what would become the Berklee School of Music in Boston. He gave it up, however, to go on the road with Lionel Hampton's band as a teenage trumpet player in the early 1950s.

"Music was the one thing I could control," Jones wrote in his autobiography. "It was the one world that offered me freedom ... I didn't have to search for answers. The answers lay no further than the bell of my trumpet and my scrawled, penciled scores. Music made me full, strong, popular, self-reliant and cool."

In the late 1950s he went on US government-sponsored tours around the world with a band organised by bebop jazz pioneer Dizzy Gillespie. Jones then led his own band through Europe. He was deeply in debt in the early 1960s when he took a job at Mercury Records in New York, becoming one of the first Black executives at a white-owned record company.

There, Jones ventured out of the jazz genre and produced his first hit single, _It's My Party_, a Lesley Gore song that topped the US pop chart in 1964.

Jazz purists called him a sell-out for making pop music but Jones later told Rolling Stone: "The underlying motivation for any artist, be it Stravinsky or Miles Davis, is to make the kind of music they want and still have everyone buy it."

At Mercury, Jones got his first movie-scoring job, Sidney Lumet's _The Pawnbroker_. He went on to score nearly 40 films, including _In the Heat of the Night_, _In Cold Blood_, _Mackenna's Gold_, _The Wiz_ and part of the television mini-series _Roots_.

The people Jones worked with would populate a jazz or R&B hall of fame - Basie, Gillespie, Tommy Dorsey, Dinah Washington, Nat King Cole, Sarah Vaughan, Aretha Franklin. But he also produced in other genres with, among others, Paul Simon, Amy Winehouse, Barbra Streisand, and Donna Summer.

He arranged Sinatra's hit _Fly Me to the Moon_ that astronaut Buzz Aldrin played a cassette recording of during the first moon landing in 1969. Years later, Jones told _GQ_ magazine that Sinatra "called me up, and he was like a little kid: 'We got the first music on the moon, man!'"

His own recordings were just as eclectic, veering from jazz to soul, African to Brazilian. In 1991 his _Back on the Block_ record won the Grammy for album of the year and also Grammys in the rap, rhythm and blues, jazz fusion and instrumental categories.

Jones' work with Jackson was historic, although Jackson's record company initially thought Jones was too jazzy to be his producer. They started in 1979 with _Off the Wall_, after the singer had split from his brothers in the Jackson 5 and put together a mix of dance tracks and ballads. The album featured four songs that became top 10 hits.

Their 1982 collaboration, _Thriller_, became a cultural touchstone of the 1980s. Jones and Jackson wanted to broaden Jackson's fan base so they added rock elements, getting guitarist Eddie Van Halen to play a blistering solo on _Beat It_, which became one of Jackon's biggest hits ever. Complemented by dazzling videos featuring Jackson's mesmerising dancing just as MTV was coming of age, _Thriller_ made the entertainer one of the biggest stars in the world.

**Divine collaboration**

Hits like _Beat It_, _Billie Jean_ and the title song made _Thriller_ the biggest selling album of all time. It won three Grammys for Jones and seven for Jackson.

They followed that in 1987 with _Bad_, which had five No. 1 hits, including _Smooth Criminal_ and _Man in the Mirror_.

In 1985, Jones, Jackson and singer Lionel Richie organised _We Are the World_, a record to raise money for fighting famine in Ethiopia. The huge all-star chorus featured Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, Diana Ross, Bruce Springsteen and Smokey Robinson. Jones set the tone for the recording session with a sign that said: "Leave your ego at the door."

Jackson died in 2009, and Jones later sued the estate, testifying that he was "cheated out of a lot of money" in royalties. In July 2017, a Los Angeles jury awarded Jones $9.4 million.

Jones started his own record label, Qwest, as well as _Vibe_, a magazine that covered the hip-hop world, and had various foundations and humanitarian projects.

He kept launching new projects well past the traditional retirement age. In 2018, Jones, then 84, told _GQ_ magazine: "I never been this busy in my life."

Jones was married three times. His first wife was his high school sweetheart Jeri Caldwell with whom he had one daughter; his second wife was Swedish model Ulla Andersson with whom he had two children, including Quincy III, who became a hip-hop producer.

His third wife was _Mod Squad_ actress Peggy Lipton, with whom he had two daughters, including actress Rashida Jones. He had two other children outside his marriages, including one with actress Nastassja Kinski.

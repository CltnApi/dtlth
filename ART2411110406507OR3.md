SURAT THANI - Searchers have found and recovered the body of an **Indian tourist** who **fell from a cliff** while walking to the top of a popular **waterfall** on Koh Samui.

Local officials and rescue volunteers from several units on the resort island were involved in the search. They found 28-year-old Sreemany Debjit's body snaggedÂ  between tree limbs and a rock on the lowest level of Na Muang 2 Waterfall.

The dead man's friend said he and Debjit had been climbing the trail to the summit of the waterfall on Saturday. Debit slipped and fell off the cliff while taking photos. Unable to find Debit, his friend had hurried back down the trail and sought help.

The search began on Saturday but was cut short by heavy rain that sent a torrent of water pouring over the falls. It resumed on Sunday.

Debjit's body was taken to Koh Samui Hospital.

Na Muang 2 Waterfall is about 500 metres from Na Muang 1 in Koh Samui district in Surat Thani province. It is 80 metres high, according to the Samui municipal office.

How mental barriers affect a player's game

The psychological area that comes with the game of golf is hugely underestimated. If you don't think hard about how your brain is working, as you are walking around the course it is important, think of all the players who used to play great yet couldn't even hit a cow's backside with a cricket bat.

Lack of confidence can stem from as little as a 10-minute period of time when, for example; Jordan Spieth taking a 6 on a par 3 or hitting a spectator with a wild hook with their first drive like Ernie Els did. Financial or marital problems can also be the reason for suddenly playing a 74 as opposed to a 68 that you did, so easily, previously. The mind games that golf throws at you are numerous.

You must have a consistent repeating swing -- that's Step One. This is to be able to hit the ball in the general direction you wish it to go in. Step Two is to have some sort of a plan when standing on the 1st tee of how you're going to negotiate the next 18 holes. Step Three is being able to stick to steps 1 and 2 and not start thinking of any problems you might have at home or allowing any negative thoughts to enter your head during the next 4 or 5 hours. It's hard to hear moans and groans from once really good players who have had a really good innings, when suddenly realising that their results are not good enough anymore. It's a struggle for some to face the reality of not being the player they once were and perhaps it's time to put their clubs in the corner of the garage.

**Out of Bounds:** Success in golf is the result of hard work, persistence and learning from failure.

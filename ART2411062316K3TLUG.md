Thai League 1 giants Port play their first match since the shock resignation of their coach Rangsan Viwatchaichok when they take on China's Zhejiang in an AFC Champions League Two Group F away game Thursday night.

Rangsan quit his job in the wake of a 2-0 loss to Bangkok United on Saturday.

Choketawee Promrut, who has taken over as Port's interim coach, said on Wednesday: "The atmosphere in the team is good. Our players know their duty. We will play for the name of our country and the club.

"We have been together for a long time. This is an important match. If we win this game, we will have a chance to make it to the next round.

"I am sure every player will focus on the game. We will do our best for a good result."

Port midfielder Peeradol Chamratsamee also said: "The team is OK. The players are professional enough to know what to do. We will do our best and hope the Thai fans will cheer our team."

In a Group H game on Thursday, Muang Thong United head into a crucial away battle with Dynamic Herb Cebu of the Philippines on the back of four straight losses in the domestic league.

A new Thai mystery series created in collaboration with Hub Ho Hin Bangkok and Netflix, "Don't Come Home", offers a fresh take on thrillers and premieres on Halloween.

Home is often seen as a sanctuary, a place of warmth and security where we seek refuge. But what if home becomes a place one should never return to, a place that welcomes no one and offers no comfort?

The compelling storyline is brought to life by Thai actresses, Woranuch Bhirombhakdi, Pitchapa Phanthumchinda and Cindy Sirinya Bishop. The trailer, which is out on Netflix, offers a glimpse into the chilling events that transpire behind the door of the Jarukanant house setting the stage for a suspenseful journey that culminates on Oct 31.

A new dimension of mystery, unfolding at a breathless pace in _Don't Come Home_, which is directed and written by Woottidanai Intarakaset, an award-winning commercial director making his long-form content debut. “Directing this series has allowed me to pursue that dream and pour my heart and soul into it. This project has been a labour of love, which I'm incredibly proud of. Please watch from the beginning to end, because this series might take you on a journey beyond expectation,” he says.  

Central to the mystery of _Don't Come Home_ is the Jarukanant house, a mansion designed and built specifically for the series. Inspired by Sino-European architecture and the lush rainforest of Thailand, Woottidanai also played a key role in crafting its mysterious and suspenseful atmosphere, while ensuring it visually enhanced the storytelling. 

He shares his perspective on designing the Jarukanant house, “As I was writing the script, I started visualising the spaces. Then I sketched out the floor plan and consulted with the production design team, taking into account what should be visible in each scene, where the characters would move, and what they would encounter. The house itself becomes a crucial element in conveying the series' themes and messages.

"I wanted to create a story filled with mystery, complexity and suspense, leading to something that might defy expectations. My goal was to push the boundaries of Thai content, aiming for a plot that takes the audience by surprise. The series delves into various issues and is told through the strong female lead characters," says Woottidanai. _Don’t Come Home_ features a captivating trio of acclaimed actresses — Woranuch, Pitchapa and Cindy.

The series marks the first time these three and the director have worked together, as well as their first collaboration with Netflix. “Filming 'Don't Come Home' was fun and incredibly challenging, given that the series is quite complex, with many emotional scenes. Throughout the shoot, I immersed myself in Varee's world and embodied her in every moment. My goal was to portray her as authentically as possible, staying true to the vision of the director and writer.  Plus, this was my first time working with Netflix, and it was such a professional experience. From the pre-production planning to the set production design, the cast, the costumes — everything was top-notch. I'm thrilled to see how it all comes together on Netflix,” says Woranuch.  

Prepare to uncover the mysteries hidden within the walls of the Jarukanant house — a place Varee hoped would offer refuge, but instead, becomes the setting for a life-altering journey she never could have imagined. 

Witness the investigation of unusual events taking place in Jarukanant house after Varee takes her only daughter Min (Ploypaphas Fonkaewsiwaporn) to the remote family mansion where she lived 30 years ago. They both encounter inexplicable incidents in this house. One day, Min mysteriously disappears, prompting Fah (Pitchapa), a pregnant police officer, to investigate. As Fah delves deeper, the evidence points towards a sinister secret hidden within the old house's walls.

_Don’t Come Home_ is penned by Aummaraporn Phandinthong, the mind behind _Analog Squad_ and _The Believers_, to develop the characters and their background stories, adding depth and balance to the story. The series is further elevated by a talented supporting cast, including Thiraphat Sajakul, Sahatchai Chumrum, Parit Thimthong and Partith Pisitkul.

"Beyond the plot of _Don’t Come Home_, I want the audience to enjoy the story, feel the suspense, and grasp the issues we are trying to convey. Ultimately, if the story resonates with the audience even after the credits roll, that would be the greatest reward for us as creators,” adds Woottidanai. 

Prepare to experience a new dimension of mystery where "home" may be the last place you want to be. _Don't Come Home_ premieres globally on Oct 31 on Netflix.

PP submits push to limit Senate's role

One of the proposals for an amendment to the constitution submitted by the People's Party (PP) seeks to exclude the Senate from the charter amendment process, according to the secretariat of the House of Representatives.

According to the House secretariat, the PP has submitted 17 proposals seeking to amend the constitution section by section.

Among the key proposals is to amend Section 256 to allow for the drafting of a new charter. The section stipulates that a charter amendment bill requires the support of at least one-third of the new 200-member Senate, or 67 senators.

However, the PP has said that the support of two-thirds of MPs should be enough, without the need for the Senate's participation.

Unlike their predecessors, the incumbent senators are not authorised to co-elect a prime minister. They still, however, retain the power to pass legislation and amendments to laws and the constitution.

They are also authorised to endorse the appointment of members of independent organisations, Constitutional Court judges, and the attorney-general as well as keeping the executive branch in check.

House Speaker Wan Muhammad Noor Matha has previously said that he will meet the chief whips of the government, the opposition, and the Senate to discuss the mechanism for considering the charter change proposals before the new parliament session begins on Dec 19.

Another amendment proposal submitted by the PP concerns Section 106 of the charter, which would allow the opposition leader to concurrently serve as the House speaker or a deputy House speaker.

Another seeks to amend Section 50, which mandates military service for male Thai citizens. The PP said conscription should only be applied during wartime.

Before it was dissolved and reborn as the PP, the Move Forward Party pushed three charter amendment proposals.

Of the three bills, one sought to abolish Section 279 of the charter, which says all announcements and orders of the now-defunct National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) and its leader remain lawful and constitutional.

Another sought to prevent and counter future coups by allowing state officials to disobey orders from those attempting to seize power and prohibit courts from recognising a coup as a means of establishing a legitimate government. The last bill proposed abolishing the 20-year national strategy.

BJT pick wins Surin PAO poll

Thanyaporn Mungcharoenporn won the Surin Provincial Administration Organisation (PAO) election on Saturday, according to unofficial results released on Saturday night.

After votes from all 2,326 polling stations were tallied, Ms Thanyaporn, the first candidate, secured the top spot with 222,756 votes.

The runner-up was Pornchai Mungcharoenporn (211,625), followed by Natthamon Siriwattanavanich (81,605), Chalong Sattarattanamai (15,504) and Patarapon Hongsoong (4,509).

There are 1.083 million eligible voters in the province, 573,454 (52.93%) of whom cast ballots.

Out of the total, 20,628 ballots were deemed invalid and 16,859 voters did not vote for any of the five.

Ms Thanyaporn is closely affiliated with the Bhumjaithai Party (BJT). Her husband, Pakorn Mungcharoenporn, is a party MP.

Broadcaster Thai PBS said her priorities are the provision of clean water for consumption, healthcare for the elderly, higher prices for rice and cattle, village development and promotion of the famous Surin silk.

Meanwhile, in Udon Thani, the election to find the province's PAO chairman was underway yesterday.

The poll followed the resignation of the former chairman Wichian Khaokham, who stepped down two months before his term ended due to health issues.

The election drew public attention as candidates from two major parties are competing: Pheu Thai's candidate and former MP for Udon Thani, Sarawut Phetphanomporn, is up against Kanisorn Khurirung, former deputy PAO chairman, who represents the People's Party. Prominent political figures last week campaigned on their behalf.

Rachan Sunhua, the provincial governor, said Udon Thani has 2,243 polling stations and a total of 1.238 million eligible voters.

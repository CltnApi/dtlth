ONE Championship: Jo Nattawut returns vs Bampara Kouyate at ONE 170 in Bangkok

Fan favourite “Smokin’” Jo Nattawut will return to ONE Championship action against Bampara Kouyate, a source told the Bangkok Post.

It is understood the featherweight Muay Thai bout will take place on January 24’s ONE 170 card at Impact Arena.

Thailand’s Nattawut, ranked No 2 in the division, will look to protect his spot from No 4-ranked Kouyate of France, and get back on track after successive defeats to champion Tawanchai PK Saenchai and new No 1 contender Superbon.

The 35-year-old was booked to rematch Tawanchai for the featherweight title at ONE 169 earlier this month, but suffered a first-round knockout by Superbon in July.

Superbon will now fight Tawanchai for the title in the main event of ONE 170, with the winner between Nattawut and Kouyate well-placed to earn the next shot at the belt.

The co-main event sees Scotland’s Nico Carrillo challenge Superlek Kiatmookao for the bantamweight Muay Thai title. 

In a third title fight, Fabricio Andrade will make the first defence of his bantamweight MMA belt against Kwon Won-Il. Andrade has been out of action since November 2023, when Jonathan Haggerty knocked him out to win the vacant bantamweight kickboxing title.

Scenes will also be shot on fight night for MMA-themed film “The Beast In Me”, which stars Academy Award winner Russell Crowe.

Elsewhere on the card, Thailand legend Seksan Or Kwanmuang faces Myanmar veteran Soe Lin Oo in a catchweight Muay Thai fight.

Myanmar will also be represented by Thant Zin, who returns against Suriyanlek Por Yenying.

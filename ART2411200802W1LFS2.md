Defence ministers and high-ranking security executives of 10 ASEAN countries are taking part in the four-day event, Thai Defence Ministry spokesman **Maj-General Thanathip Sawangsaeng** said.

He said the ADMM serves as a platform for senior defence leaders of ASEAN to become acquainted, build relationships, and exchange views both formally and informally. This would lead to a strengthening of friendship and foster greater mutual trust among ASEAN communities, he said.

Thanathip said the 18th ADMM is expected to adopt the Vientiane Joint Declaration, which aims to promote peace, security, and strengthen the region’s defence capabilities. The declaration emphasises the importance of ASEAN unity and centrality in addressing security threats within the current global context.

Under the declaration, member countries would cooperate to drive initiatives that foster greater connectivity, emphasise trust-building, and safeguard benefits of all parties within ASEAN-led mechanisms. This cooperation aims to strengthen the regional architecture with ASEAN at its centre, ultimately promoting peace and security in the Southeast Asian region, he said.

Thanathip said the meeting would also consider guidelines for observer countries participating in the activities of ADMM’s Expert Working Group. These guidelines aim to ensure clarity, transparency, and inclusiveness, allowing non-regional partners to engage in cooperation activities and support the development of ASEAN's capabilities.

For 2024-27, the meeting has approved the following countries as observers: France, United Kingdom, Canada and Turkey.

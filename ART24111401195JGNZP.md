**Thienprasit Chaiyapatranun, president of the Thai Hotel Association (THA)**, noted that the ongoing confidence index survey revealed regional disparities in concerns, with hotels in central and northern Thailand feeling the strain most acutely.

According to a survey conducted by the THA and the Bank of Thailand, around 50% of hoteliers expressed worry about the potential negative impact of foreign investment on the industry.

Chinese businesses, in particular, are seen as a significant threat, especially for budget hotels. Meanwhile, higher-end establishments are concerned about the broader implications for Thailand's tourism image.

The survey also revealed that hoteliers are anticipating a similar number of Thai tourists in the fourth quarter compared to previous quarters, with a slight uptick expected in the under 3-star segment.





**Occupancy rates and regional trends**

Overall, hotel occupancy rates are projected to reach 68% in November 2024, a significant improvement from the previous month. The southern region continues to lead with the highest average occupancy rate at 66.9%, followed by the central region at 63.2%.

Foreign tourists, primarily from Asia, the Middle East, China, and Western Europe, are driving the recovery, with a majority of them opting for 4-star and above accommodations.

**Labour shortage remains a persistent challenge, particularly for higher-end hotels. While this issue is primarily impacting service quality, it has not yet hindered the industry's ability to accommodate guests, the survey revealed.**

The Thai government is implementing several measures to boost the tourism sector, including promoting Thailand as a hub for entertainment and events, attracting world-class events, and improving infrastructure.

The Northern Half Project is also expected to stimulate tourism in the northern region, particularly in natural and eco-tourism destinations.

**The THA president called on the government to provide further support, such as measures to stimulate domestic tourism, reduce operating costs, address labour shortage, and stabilise the baht.**

By addressing these challenges and capitalising on the government's initiatives, the Thai hotel industry aims to sustain its recovery and maintain its leading position in hospitality, Thienprasit said.

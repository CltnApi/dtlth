The upcoming festive season is a good time to celebrate the taste of American excellence. Whether dining out or cooking at home, the American Beef Feast showcases the finest in American agriculture, starting tomorrow until Dec 31.

This is the biggest year-end culinary festival presented by Gourmet One Group, Thailand's leading importer of fine food products, in collaboration with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).

During this period, 17 top hotels and restaurants across Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Pattaya and Khon Kaen are going to offer an array of special dishes highlighting American beef, including USDA premium grades.

For those who enjoy cooking at home, high-quality cuts are available at 17 select branches of Tops Food Hall of Central Food Retail, offering Thai consumers the chance to experience high-quality beef renowned for its tenderness, juiciness and rich flavour.

Known for its rigorous quality standards and sustainable farming practices, American beef promises an unparalleled taste experience that delights palates and supports responsible agriculture.

Among the hotels and restaurants joining this campaign are New York Steakhouse at JW Marriott Hotel Bangkok, 57th Street at Bangkok Marriott Hotel Sukhumvit, Centara Grand at CentralWorld, InterContinental Bangkok, Anantara Chiang Mai Resort, Andaz Pattaya Jomtien Beach, Ad Lib Khon Kaen Hotel, Neil's Tavern and Sorrento Sathorn.

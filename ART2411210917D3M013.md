Since organiser Sole U Entertain announced that Hwang In-youp, a well-known South Korean actor, will host "Hwang In-youp Fan Meeting Tour \[In Love\] In Bangkok", Thai fans have been eager to book tickets.

Hwang began to capture viewers' heart when he played Goo Ja-sung, a high school bully in the 2020 drama 18 Again. His character, Goo, goes from being violent to having empathy for others.

Hwang is currently playing Kim San-ha in the drama Family By Choice on VIU. Based on Go Ahead, a highly rated Chinese show, Family By Choice, is a story of two boys and one girl who are not related by blood but have formed a sibling-like bond.

Hwang's character Kim San-ha is a young boy traumatised by his mother's abandonment. Despite his painful past, he grows up surrounded by love and care and has a strong bond with Yoon, a cheerful girl, and Kang, a talented basketball player. Besides expressing his struggles and pain, Hwang also delivers cute acting in romantic scenes.

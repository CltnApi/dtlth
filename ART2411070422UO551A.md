RIMOWA Unveils Limited-Edition Optical Cabin Suitcase

First introduced in 1950, grooves quickly became a defining feature of RIMOWA’s identity. Inspired by the golden age of aviation, the design went on to become one of the brand’s most recognisable hallmarks. Now, in a remarkable evolution, these emblematic grooves transform in a bold new direction with the introduction of a new limited-edition release: The RIMOWA Original Cabin Optical.

Inspired by optical art, the limited-edition Original Cabin Optical presents a bold reinterpretation of RIMOWA’s iconic design codes, featuring a geometric pattern that cleverly creates the illusion of its signature grooves disappearing. To achieve this dynamic, shimmering effect—where the grooves appear to shift with changes in viewing angles and light reflections—the German Maison selects between brushed and unbrushed finishes on its signature aluminium, meticulously crafted at its historic Cologne factory.

The optical art motif continues inside the case, with the jacquard patterns mirroring the shifting effect seen on the aluminium exterior. The design is featured on the Flex Dividers, RIMOWA’s compression system that allows travellers to pack more whilst keeping items in order.

The German Maison’s meticulous approach to detail and design is apparent across the new limited-edition suitcase, from the stage-free telescopic handle and the RIMOWA-pioneered Multi- Wheel system to the TSA approved locks to secure belongings during travel.

To mark the special release, the RIMOWA Original Cabin Optical also includes a specially designed leather tag featuring the same geometric optical pattern. Additionally, each of the 2002 limited- edition pieces— a number chosen for its palindromic nod to the art of perception—will feature a numbered label. Designed to be a lifelong companion, this limited-edition piece is backed by RIMOWA’s unconditional Lifetime Guarantee, ensuring it remains a symbol of craftsmanship and innovation for your journeys ahead.

Starting November 7, 2024, the limited-edition RIMOWA Original Cabin Optical (75,500 THB) is available at RIMOWA stores and online at RIMOWA.com

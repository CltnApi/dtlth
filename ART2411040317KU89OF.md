SF Corporation Public Company Limited, Thailand’s premier cinema chain, has launched the country's first fully laser-projected and DTS Surround Cinema at the new SF Cinema Lotus Yala, now open in Yala’s city centre. This landmark offers innovative visual and sound technology, paired with premium seating options, aiming to provide Thailand’s most advanced cinematic experience. 

According to Suwat Thongrompho, CEO of SF Corporation, the Lotus Yala branch introduces a fresh entertainment venue for Yala residents, themed as “Hollywood City” to recreate a cinematic cityscape. “SF Cinema Lotus Yala offers a beautiful, modern venue with three theatres and 521 seats designed to give viewers an enhanced movie experience,” Thongrompho said. 

The cinema’s ALL LASER PROJECTOR system, utilising RGB laser projectors, creates vivid images with true-to-life colours, while the DTS Surround Cinema sound system delivers a deeply immersive audio experience recognised as one of the most advanced sound technologies in the film industry. With this pioneering technology, Yala moviegoers are among the first in Thailand to enjoy such a high-calibre cinema experience. 

In addition to top-tier technology, the cinema offers two special seating options. Prime Seats offer extra-soft leather, enhanced privacy, generous legroom, and under-seat storage, while Suit Seats feature private, double leather seats with full reclining, ample space, and individual popcorn and drink stands with mobile chargers. 

To celebrate the opening, SF Cinema Lotus Yala is running exclusive promotions throughout November: 

*   Half-price movies for SF+ members on select films until 30 October.
*   Complimentary SF+ Package (regularly 100 baht) for new members until 30 November.
*   1,000 free M-size popcorns daily for app users until 14 October.
*   Free movie tickets for SF and Coke customers (10,000 seats available) with the purchase of a Combo Set or 44-ounce Coke until 6 November. 

For added excitement, customers purchasing any two movie tickets or a Combo Set with a single receipt are entered to win prizes, including a 1-baht gold necklace and other rewards totalling over 600,000 baht. 

With its blend of cutting-edge technology and exclusive comfort, SF Cinema Lotus Yala is set to offer the ultimate movie-watching experience. For showtimes and ticket purchases, customers can visit the SF Cinema app or website, and stay updated via SF Cinema’s social media channels at #SFcinema.

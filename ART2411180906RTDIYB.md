TCMA Champions Green Energy Transition with Collaborative Action

The Thai Cement Manufacturers Association (TCMA) is urging the government to accelerate the green energy transition by addressing legal and regulatory barriers, facilitating green funding, and promoting collaborative efforts under its 3C concept: Collaborative Mindset, Collaborative Action, and Collaborative Value. 

At the Energy Symposium 2024, Dr. Chana Poomee, Chairman of TCMA, highlighted progress in the cement industry’s journey towards carbon neutrality. Through the Thailand 2050 Net Zero Cement and Concrete Roadmap, certified by the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), the sector has made strides in adopting renewable energy and low-carbon solutions, particularly through the SARABURI SANDBOX LOW CARBON CITY initiative. 

**Advancing Green Energy** 

The SARABURI SANDBOX integrates a Public-Private-People Partnership (PPP) model to drive climate action in Saraburi Province. Initiatives include: 

*   Solar Carport Pilot Project: A grid modernisation system tested at Saraburi Provincial Hall, supported by the Provincial Electricity Authority and Thai Energy Service Company (ESCO). 
    

*   Adoption of alternative fuels such as biomass, refuse-derived fuel (RDF), and solar energy. 
    

*   Promotion of hydraulic cement, a low-carbon alternative, with plans to phase out high-carbon cement production by 2025. 
    

**Unlocking Laws and Regulations** 

A study by Princeton University revealed that Saraburi could produce up to 100,000 megawatts of renewable energy, exceeding its energy demand of 30,000 megawatts. 

“TCMA is focused on driving the energy transition,” said Dr. Chana. “Currently, renewable energy accounts for 30% of the industry’s consumption, and further progress requires regulatory reforms to enable direct electricity trading between producers and consumers. This model could optimise Saraburi’s waste management, reduce costs, and accelerate the transition to green energy.” 

Dr. Chana’s call aligns with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy, Mr. Pirapan Salirathavibhaga, who emphasised the importance of regulatory reform under the “Remove, Reduce, Release, Regenerate” strategy. Collaborative efforts with key agencies aim to empower industries to produce clean energy and enhance energy security. 

**Collective Action and Global Connectivity** 

Since its launch in August 2023, the SARABURI SANDBOX has achieved significant progress under its PPP model. With coordination from the Federation of Thai Industries-Saraburi Province, the initiative links local, national, and global stakeholders. 

The initiative has gained international recognition, becoming Thailand’s first industrial cluster to join the Transitioning Industrial Clusters Initiative of the World Economic Forum, making it the third in ASEAN and the 21st globally. TCMA also actively collaborates with global platforms like the GCCA CEO Gathering, Climate Week NYC, and COP27, reinforcing Thailand’s commitment to climate action. 

“SARABURI SANDBOX serves as an innovative model for collaborative action. By advancing pilot projects and fostering long-term development through the Collaborative Working Process, we aim to create shared value and drive sustainability,” said Dr. Chana. 

**A Vision for 2050** 

Dr. Chana concluded, “The Thailand 2050 Net Zero Cement and Concrete Roadmap provides a clear framework for policy, technology, and funding to accelerate the green energy transition. By fostering partnerships at domestic and international levels, TCMA is committed to enhancing the industry’s global competitiveness while achieving sustainability goals.”

**Bangkok, Thailand – The Embassy of Switzerland in Thailand, led by Mr. Pedro Zwahlen, the Ambassador of Switzerland to Thailand, Cambodia, and Lao PDR, along with Novartis (Thailand) Limited, hosted the second forum under the theme Cardio Catalyst: Driving Change in Heart Health, reaffirming the commitment to improving the quality of cardiovascular care and promoting the health and well-being of Thai citizens. The event was honoured by the presence of H.E. Somsak Thepsuthin, Minister of Public Health of Thailand, and Kevin Zou, Head of the Asia Aspiring Cluster at Novartis International, at the Residence of the Swiss Ambassador.**

The forum featured panel discussions with cardiologists, providing an opportunity for stakeholders to exchange perspectives on raising awareness, advancing treatments, and fostering collaboration to achieve meaningful outcomes in heart health. 

Additionally, the Minister of Public Health presented the AHA Get With The Guidelines Heart Failure award plaque to six Thai hospitals, recognising and commending their excellence and commitment as well as for receiving international-based quality improvement certification for heart failure care from the American Heart Association. This achievement underscores the establishment of high standards and patient care delivered at an international level.

**Dr. Sopon Iamsirithaworn, Inspector General of Health Region 2 at the Ministry of Public Health,** stated, _“This forum presents a crucial opportunity to address the challenge of cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of death in both Thailand and globally. According to data from the Department of Medical Services, Ministry of Public Health, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease continues to rise each year, particularly among those aged_ _60 and over, as well as the younger working-age population. The Ministry of Public Health recognises the severity of this issue and has prioritised it as one of the core strategies. This includes fostering collaboration between the public sector, private organisations, and medical institutions to drive new initiatives and innovations, such as the establishment of heart failure clinics and the development of various applications to enhance the efficiency of screening, monitoring, and advising individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease. On this occasion, we commend the team of doctors and experts who have received awards from the American Heart Association, reaffirming their dedication to advancing the standard of care for heart failure patients in an effective and sustainable manner.”_

**Pol. Maj. Gen. Dr. Kasem Ratanasumawong, President of The Heart Association of Thailand,** explained that the current approach to cardiovascular disease treatment is divided into two key areas: managing patients who already have cardiovascular disease and preventing the disease in individuals with risk factors who have not yet developed the condition. In terms of patient care, Thailand has made continuous advancements in treatment, driven by the Ministry of Public Health alongside various agencies and professional associations, including the Heart Association of Thailand under Royal Patronage of H.M. the King. A notable development is the implementation of the ‘Fast Track’ system, which enables patients with acute coronary syndrome to swiftly access treatment, resulting in improved outcomes. Furthermore, the establishment of ‘heart failure clinics’ in hospitals nationwide, supported by multidisciplinary teams, ensures that patients receive care to internationally recognised standards. For those at risk of developing cardiovascular disease, prevention efforts focus on raising public awareness of the risk factors, warning signs, and dangers of the disease. Misinformation circulating on social media has caused confusion among the public regarding lifestyle changes, diet, exercise, the use of dietary supplements, and concerns about medication side effects. To address this, the association has launched the website ThaiHealthyHeart.com, which serves as a reliable source of information to promote accurate understanding of prevention and self-care, particularly for those with risk factors. Additionally, the association has developed guidelines for the medical management of patients with acute coronary syndrome, chronic myocardial infarction, and heart failure.

_“The Cardio Catalyst: Driving Change in Heart Health event today marks an important starting point in advancing the care of patients with cardiovascular disease, a major public health issue in Thailand. It is viewed as an opportunity to align efforts and promote cooperation across all sectors to improve the health and quality of life of the Thai population, ultimately aiming to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease.”_

In addition to this, the **4A principles** for developing a cardiovascular disease care system in Thailand were also mentioned. These include emphasis on **awareness of the disease, assessment of disease risk, accessibility to appropriate standard treatment, and adherence to treatment and medication.**

**Sumalee Kristarnin, Country President of Novartis (Thailand) Co., Ltd.,** further accentuated the importance of raising awareness and understanding of the causes and risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, aiming to reduce its incidence and enhance treatment outcomes.

_“At Novartis, we recognise that fatalities from cardiovascular disease are preventable. We believe that by collaborating with patients, healthcare professionals, and organisations globally, we can achieve significant advancements in heart disease care that extend beyond medication. Building on last year’s achievements, we are committed to driving positive changes in cardiovascular disease management, which increasingly affects not only older adults but also younger populations worldwide. By raising awareness about this condition across all sectors, we are partnering with various stakeholders to enhance the standard of heart failure treatment. We are proud to contribute to this progress and extend our gratitude to the hospitals and healthcare teams that are instrumental in providing dedicated care to patients. Together, we can help individuals with cardiovascular disease live longer, healthier lives and spend more time with their loved ones.”_

This forum and associated activities represent a robust collaboration across all sectors to promote heart health and reduce mortality rates, enabling patients to live longer, experience fewer hospitalisations, and improve their overall quality of life. This initiative underscores Novartis’ commitment to fostering a sustainable and enhanced quality of life for the Thai population. Furthermore, the public can play a vital role in decreasing the incidence of cardiovascular diseases by regularly monitoring their heart health, caring for their families and loved ones to prevent and mitigate risk factors, and encouraging patients to adhere to their treatment regimens. By working together, we can significantly improve the prospects for individuals living with these conditions, ultimately empowering them to lead fulfilling and healthy lives.

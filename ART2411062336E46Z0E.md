PM signs off on Isoc integrity project banning 'gifts'

Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has kicked off the "No Gift Policy" for the Internal Security Operations Command (Isoc), ensuring its officers do not receive gifts in return for their services.

Ms Paetongtarn, in her role as Isoc director, recently signed a declaration of intent dated Oct 30 regarding the the policy, which marks the refusal of any gifts or gratuities by Isoc officers in connection with their duties.

The declaration emphasises the Isoc's commitment to maintaining national security and public peace through transparent and corruption-free operations.

"The agency's duties include planning, directing, coordinating and supporting the implementation of strategies and measures for the prevention, suppression, containment, and resolution of incidents that pose or may pose a threat to national security in all forms," it said. "The Isoc places great importance on preventing and deterring corruption and misconduct as part of its mission."

According to the announcement, the "No Gift Policy" is designed to foster a culture of integrity within the Isoc, instilling values of honesty and accountability among its personnel at all levels.

It prohibits Isoc officers from receiving any gifts of appreciation during holidays or on other occasions to prevent any conflicts of interest that could influence their decisions connected to their duties. This policy has been promulgated among all Isoc officers to ensure they perform their duties with honesty and transparency.

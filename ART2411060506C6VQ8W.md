The Myanmar Corn Industrial Association (MCIA) is committed to advancing sustainability and transparency in the corn industry through the adoption of CP Group’s new traceability system. This initiative, championed by MCIA Chairman U Aye Chan Aung, strengthens a key collaboration between public and private sectors, aiming to engage every farmer and operator across the industry.

Recently, MCIA announced its partnership with Charoen Pokphand Produce Company Limited (CPP) and Bangkok Produce Public Company Limited, a CP Group subsidiary, on a project aimed at enhancing the traceability of Myanmar’s corn supply chain, from cultivation to export. This initiative promises to bring increased sustainability and transparency, benefiting the region economically, socially, and environmentally.

Mr. U Aye Chan Aung highlighted that CP Group’s traceability system will build confidence in the origin and transparency of Myanmar’s corn, making it more attractive to markets that demand sustainably sourced raw materials. By participating, farmers can gain access to markets with high standards, adding value to their produce and providing assurance to domestic and international buyers. This traceability system will also encourage sustainable farming practices, enhancing long-term trust in Myanmar’s agricultural output.

The traceability system offers corn traders verifiable proof of sustainable sourcing, meeting environmental standards required by international markets. In addition to adding product value, it reduces business risks through detailed traceability data for raw materials.

Mr. U Aye Chan Aung underscored the role of technology in tackling environmental issues, including deforestation prevention and supporting eco-friendly farming. This approach is critical to local and global efforts to mitigate environmental and health risks.

In the long term, this connection between private sector players, farmers, and operators will lay a strong foundation for Myanmar’s sustainable corn industry. MCIA is committed to supporting the adoption of this system nationwide, fostering collaboration to elevate industry transparency and sustainability.

Dr. Pyo Ko Ko Naing, Managing Director of Alliance Eagles Group Limited and an MCIA board member, praised the collaboration among government, private sectors, and farmers in advancing the industry with traceability. This initiative will enhance the supply chain’s sustainability and transparency from cultivation to export.

Founded in 2019, MCIA aims to strengthen collaboration across Myanmar’s corn industry, supporting sustainable development, agricultural financing, and fostering eco-friendly cultivation practices. Additionally, MCIA advocates for the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution (AATH) to prevent regional pollution from deforestation fires, reducing health and environmental impacts.

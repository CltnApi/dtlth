This collection captures his journey documenting the lives of the people behind this ancient art. The accompanying photography exhibition will be featured at the **27th Harmony World Puppet Innovation 2024** at the **National Science Museum in Pathum Thani**.

**Constantine Korsovitis**, an Australian photographer, brings his love for documentary photography to life through the stories, people, and connections he captures. Working with both analogue film and digital techniques, his photographs have been showcased in galleries, museums, and festivals worldwide since 1998. In 2012, he earned a Master’s degree in **Documentary Photography** from the **University of Sydney**.

Constantine’s journey into shadow puppetry began in 1999 when the Indonesian Secretariat of Wayang invited him to document the International Wayang Festival in **Jakarta**.

His first exhibition followed in 2001 at the **India International Centre in Delhi**, and in 2010, he showcased his work at the **Unima Festival** in **Perth**. In 2016, his photographs were exhibited at the Kelantan State Museum in Kota Bharu, and in 2018, with support from Thailand’s Ministry of Culture, he presented a selection of his work at the **Ratchadamnoen Contemporary Art Center** in **Bangkok**.

Since 1999, Constantine has documented the world of shadow puppetry through intimate conversations and photographs of puppeteers, puppet makers, musicians, and art experts from various countries. Inspired by performances at festivals, he shaped his work to capture the enduring beauty of this traditional art form, which remains vibrant amid rapid global change.

Korsovitis reflects, "In 1999, I had the chance to capture the International Shadow Puppet Festival in Jakarta. For three days, I was mesmerized by the performances, and it sparked a passion to document this unique art form and delve into the lives of its artists. I wanted to photograph puppeteers not in the spotlight, but in their own spaces, speaking with them, and understanding them beyond their art. Through my journey across countries and cultures, I discovered that these artists carry a profound sense of wonder, mystery, and history. My work seeks to honour the beauty of shadow puppetry and the unwavering spirit of the artists who dedicate their lives to it."

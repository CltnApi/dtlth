This art-toy event will allow fans of all ages to immerse themselves in a vibrant world of creativity and design.

Kicking off with the popular ROBBiART label – creator of the iconic ROBBi toy from China – ICONSIAM is collaborating with Bangkok Illumination to host a Christmas-tree lighting festival.

Titled "**ICONSIAM Bangkok Illumination 2025 x ROBBiART**", this event aims to transform River Park into a stunning exhibition of sculptures, culminating in a grand Christmas-tree celebration with the theme "**Radiant Reinvention Bangkok Illumination 2025**".

This marks the first partnership between ICONSIAM and ROBBiART, elevating the festive experience throughout November and December.

In addition to the ROBBi display, ICONSIAM has partnered with More Dan Art & Toys to present a limited-edition showcase at "**Fluffy Wonderland**", featuring popular characters such as Famer Bob, Rico, and zZoton.

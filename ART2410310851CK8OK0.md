MGallery Residences MontAzure, a freehold lakeside condominium and Thailand's first MGallery branded residence managed by the internationally renowned AccorHotels, recently celebrated its topping-off ceremony. This significant milestone marks the successful completion of the project’s structural framework, bolstering confidence in its progress and scheduled delivery for unit owners, setting the stage for the highly anticipated grand unveiling. 

Situated within the prestigious MontAzure masterplan at Phuket’s Kamala Beach, MGallery Residences MontAzure presents a unique opportunity for discerning buyers and investors seeking a slice of luxury living in Thailand. With 65% of the units already sold, the project remains on track for handover in Q1 2025, blending beachside tranquillity with high-end services

“The topping-off ceremony is an affirmation of the development’s successful advancement and our commitment to delivering a high-quality project within the scheduled timeframe,” said Mr. Setthaphol Boottho, MontAzure’s Executive Director. “We are confident that, once complete, MGallery Residences MontAzure will be a highly sought-after address for both domestic and international buyers, offering the privilege of owning a branded residence with a prestigious lifestyle surrounded by the serene beauty of Phuket’s Kamala Beach.” 

**Luxury Living Redefined** 

MGallery Residences MontAzure is set to become a landmark in Thailand’s real estate market, delivering a lifestyle experience inspired by the unique charm of the MGallery brand. Nestled in a prime beachside location, the residences are meticulously designed to embody exclusivity and elegance, featuring striking architecture, expansive living spaces, high-end finishes, sweeping views, and access to world-class amenities. 

Primarily developed as a resort, MGallery Residences MontAzure comprises suites and one-bedroom apartments, totalling 227 units. Buyers have the option to combine units to create two- or three-bedroom configurations. Located within MontAzure’s luxury residential resort development, the project spans 454 rai (178 acres, 72 hectares), stretching from the 250-metre beachfront up to the Kamala mountainside. 

Enhancing the luxury experience for residents is an exceptional loyalty programme from both Accor and MontAzure.

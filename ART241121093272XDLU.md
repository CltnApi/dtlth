Chiang Rai United have parted ways with their Spanish coach Xabi Moro after a string of poor results.

The Beetles announced Wednesday that they have terminated Moro's contract with the club.

A club statement claimed that the move came after Moro requested the termination of his contract, citing that he was needed back in Spain to take care of his family.

Moro, a former Barcelona football academy player from 1988-1993, played for the Spanish U18 and U19 teams.

Moro was the former assistant coach of Bangkok Glass (now BG Pathum United) in 2017-2018. He was appointed as the head coach of Chiang Rai United before the season kicked off in July.

Chiang Rai this season have claimed only seven points from 11 matches and are currently in 14th place, facing relegation.

Moro became the eighth coach in Thai League 1 to lose his job this season. The others were Jakkapan Panpee (Uthai Thani), Tana Chanabut (Khon Kaen United), Akbar Nawas (Nakhon Pathom United), Surapong Kongthep (Ratchaburi FC), Makoto Teguramori (BG Pathum United), Carlos Eduardo (Rayong FC) and Sirisak Yodyarthai (Nakhon Pathom United).

Quota for foreign players

Football Association of Thailand (FAT) president Nualphan Lamam has announced that the Thai League 1 will be allowed a bigger quota of foreign players starting next season.

"This has been agreed by all the 16 top-flight clubs and the move is aimed at elevating the standard of the league," said Nualphan.

"We need to have an exciting league so that fans remain loyal to it.

"We also need to make sure that our top league is on a par with the other leagues in the Asian continent."

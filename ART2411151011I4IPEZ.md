**Prawit Janyasittikul, Chief Executive Officer of Phuket Square Co., Ltd.**, which operates Jungceylon Shopping Center in Patong, Phuket, stated, _**“Jungceylon is a must-visit destination for tourists from around the world when they travel to Patong, Phuket. The rising global popularity of art toys and collectible toys, which appeal to all ages and convey meaning beyond language, highlights a unique connection between ‘art toys’ and ‘Jungceylon.’ Through collaboration with world-renowned artists, we have created ‘DOTOY X JUNGCEYLON’ as a year-end gift, welcoming the New Year 2025 for both Phuket residents and international tourists.”**_

For the end of this year, the company is ready to allocate over 20 million baht in marketing funds to organise promotional events, advertising, and a series of vibrant activities to bring joy to both Thai and international shoppers and tourists. This celebration, marking the end of the year and the New Year’s festivities, reaffirms its status as a “Shopping Destination in Patong.”

This year’s theme, **“DOTOY X JUNGCEYLON,”** will feature the **“Angel Boy”** art toy character, a mischievous boy with horns who loves chewing gum and blowing bubbles. This creation is the work of Korean artists **Yoon Kiseok** and **Min Kyungsun** from DOTOY (DO IT YOURSELF TOY), who collaborated with Jungceylon Shopping Center, Patong, Phuket.



The center will be transformed into a festive wonderland under the concept “**Wish and Desire**,” filled with the playful, bright, and fun character Angel Boy in various poses and activities throughout the shopping center.

The highlight will be a giant “**Angel Boy**” Christmas tree balloon over 10 meters tall, featuring Angel Boy in a bright pink dolphin suit, symbolising Patong Municipality. This installation will serve as a new landmark for Phuket residents and tourists to check in and enhance the festive shopping atmosphere.

Prawit further stated that “_**For Phuket’s high season, Jungceylon is packed with activities and entertainment to welcome tourists from around the world, beginning in November 2024. He anticipates that in the final quarter, the center will see tourist traffic of no less than 45,000–50,000 visitors per day, an increase of 15–20%. The main target remains international tourists, making up over 80%, with most visitors from Europe, such as Russia, Australia, the UK, Germany, the United States, and Scandinavia.

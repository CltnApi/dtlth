As EVA Air has renewed its LOI with the Tourism Authority of Thailand, EVA Air Executive Vice President Liao has also shared the airline’s plans to launch new cities to further enhance this collaboration.



He noted that for Southeast Asia, the available transfer cities include Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei (Taoyuan), and Hong Kong. Compared to airports in other countries, which tend to be large and have longer transfer times, Taoyuan Airport is "small but beautiful," allowing for quicker transfers without much waiting time. Additionally, with the high frequency of Southeast Asian flights, passengers don’t have to wait half a day for connecting flights, which gives Taoyuan Airport an advantage over other airports.





Also, it is considering the rising demand for transfer services due to the shifting supply chain, Southeast Asia to North America transfer routes remain a priority, with cities like Boston, Washington, and Dallas in North America being evaluated for future expansion.

_**“Besides, we currently offer 28 flights per week between Bangkok and Taipei, 7 flights between Chiangmai and Taipei. According to statistics, 910,000 travelers from Taiwan have visited Thailand so far. In response to this demand, we plan to add 4 additional flights per week from 15 January to 29 March, 2025, bringing the total to 39 weekly flights from Thailand to Taipei,” he added.**_

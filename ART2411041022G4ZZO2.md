Mr. Patrick Girod, CEO of L'Oréal Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia

**Mr. Patrick Girod, CEO of L'Oréal Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia****,** remarked, "As we celebrate our 115th year, L'Oréal, as a global beauty company, believes that beauty is rooted in science. We are fully aware of the importance of scientific innovation for the world. However, the representation of Thai female scientist at senior levels remains far from equal. From 1982 to the present, only 16% of recipients of prestigious scientific awards have been women, despite the equal number of men and women in Thai scientific fields.  We firmly believe that the world needs science, and science needs women. L'Oréal has therefore continued to honour outstanding scientific achievements by women through the 'For Women in Science' program for 22 years, inspiring young women who wish to pursue careers in science and proving that every woman can shine in her own way.”

**Fellowship in two fields are granted to three female researchers from three institutions:**

Life Sciences (1 recipient)

1.  **Assoc. Prof. Dr. Anyanee Kamkaew,** from the Institute of Science at Suranaree University of Technology, for her research titled “Development of Photosensitizers and Nano-Delivery Systems as Alternative Precision Medicine for Cancer Treatment.”

Physical Sciences (2 recipients)

1.  **Dr. Pongkarn Chakthranont** from the National Nanotechnology Center, National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA), for her research titled “Electrocatalytic Systems for Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Sustainable Chemistry.”
2.  **Asst. Prof. Dr. Waleeporn Donphai,** from the Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering at Kasetsart University, for her research titled “Greenhouse Gas Utilization through Catalytic Mechanisms for Sustainable Agriculture and Industry towards Net Zero Emissions.”

**The three outstanding female researchers awarded in the 2024 program shared insights into their innovative projects:**

**Assoc. Prof. Dr. Anyanee Kamkaew from the Institute of Science at Suranaree University of Technology, recipient in Biological Sciences,** explained: “Despite advances in pharmacological and light-based cancer therapy over the last few decades, there remain some limitations that impede widespread clinical use. Improving photosensitiser structure and delivery technologies to target cancer cells is essential. Developing customised carriers with localised light stimulation can improve outcomes while reducing negative effects. Our research team combines Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) and Photothermal Therapy (PTT) with non-toxic nanomaterials. We primarily work on developing photosensitisers that respond to light and efficiently destroy cancer cells when activated while being non-toxic when not activated. We synthesise compounds, verify their structure, and test their optical properties. Next, nanocarriers tailored for cancer cell targeting are designed and tested in cancer cells vs normal cells under both light-stimulated and non-light-stimulated circumstances. Finally, animal models are used to study the effects of photosensitisers and nano-delivery systems on the body, both with and without light stimulation. The results reveal that numerous classes of fluorescents and photosensitisers were successfully developed and tested in laboratory settings.  Each photosensitiser class is specific to distinct light wavelengths and cancer types, allowing many possibilities for future cancer treatment research. Additionally, we developed nanodelivery systems that specifically accumulate in tumours, showing potential in animal models and paving the path for future clinical applications. This research not only advances knowledge on designing photosensitive organic molecules and building nanodelivery systems but also opens doors for collaborative efforts to expand cancer treatment options.We aim to increase cancer awareness, encourage early screenings, and support early-stage therapy, hence improving treatment options for cancer patients in Thailand.”

**Dr. Pongkarn Chakthranont from the National Nanotechnology Center at NSTDA, recipient in the field of Physical Sciences,** said: “Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from energy and manufacturing sectors underscore the urgent need for technologies such as Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS) to help achieve Thailand’s carbon neutrality goal. My research focuses on the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR), which can produce high-value chemicals. However, significant challenges remain, including complex mechanisms, high energy demands, and low selectivity. In a typical CO2 conversion system, reactions occur within a cell comprising two electrodes: CO2RR at the cathode and water oxidisation at the anode to produce oxygen, both requiring considerable energy. This research aims to develop an advanced electrochemical cell that efficiently conducts two reactions: reducing CO2 into valuable chemicals and oxidising biomass from agricultural and paper industries into bio-based chemicals. Our key objectives include developing highly selective catalysts for the CO2RR, testing these catalysts in scalable electrochemical cells, and optimising their properties to ensure a stable, impurity-resistant system. Simultaneously, we identify biomass resources suitable for electrochemical reactions and develop an oxidation system for these raw materials, with a thorough analysis of resulting products and their potential applications. Ultimately, the project will integrate CO2RR and biomass oxidation into a coupled reaction system, followed by an economic feasibility study and a life cycle analysis. If successful, this technology will be scaled for industrial use, supporting decarbonisation in heavy industries and fostering sustainable growth in Thailand's chemical and energy sectors.”

**Asst. Prof. Dr. Waleeporn Donphai from the Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering at Kasetsart University, recipient in the field of Physical Sciences,** stated: “The continuous increase in greenhouse gas emissions has severely impacted the global climate. Thailand has committed to reducing emissions alongside the global community, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2065. Various sectors are now focusing on utilising greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide and methane, by converting them into high-value products through catalytic reactions. Key reactions of interest include ‘Methane Decomposition’ and ‘Dry Reforming,’ as they not only utilise greenhouse gases but also produce renewable and clean energy.”

Dr. Waleeporn’s research focuses on three areas:

1.  **Utilising Agricultural Waste:** This area explores the use of agricultural waste as secondary raw materials, specifically synthesising sodium silicate from sugarcane bagasse ash, a byproduct of sugar production. The research investigates the composition and structure of silica synthesised from ash.
2.  **Developing Catalysts for Methane Conversion:** This involves creating catalysts to convert methane into high-value products such as hydrogen and carbon. 
3.  **Developing Catalysts for Dry Reforming:** The study develops catalysts to convert carbon dioxide and methane into hydrogen and carbon monoxide via the dry reforming process.

This research advances greenhouse gas utilisation through nanotechnology, aiming to reduce pollution, lower waste disposal costs, and foster sustainable production systems. It benefits industries seeking to reduce emissions or make use of methane and carbon dioxide, while also supporting a circular economy by repurposing waste products like sugarcane bagasse ash. Ultimately, this work aligns with Thailand's goal of achieving net-zero emissions and addressing critical economic, social, and environmental challenges.

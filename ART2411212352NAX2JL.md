iCon fraud victims can claim assets

Victims of the scandal-hit The iCon Group can now regain their assets from the Anti-Money Laundering Office (Amlo), the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) said yesterday.

After the DSI accused the direct sales company and 18 suspects of colluding in public fraud and inputting false information into a computer system, the assets were transferred to Amlo as part of the investigations.

The victims of the fraud scandal can now petition for asset refunds and financial compensation through the Amlo website (www.amlo.go.th) from now until Feb 17, 2025, the DSI said.

Currently, 18 iCon Group executives, including its CEO Warathaphon Waratyaworrakul, are in detention at the Bangkok Remand Prison and the Central Women's Correctional Institution.

Witoon Kengngan, a lawyer for The iCon Group executives, visited the 11 male suspects at the Bangkok Remand Prison yesterday to discuss their trial defence. The visit followed the DSI's questioning of the detained male executives, which concluded on Wednesday, ahead of the originally planned conclusion set for yesterday.

Mr Witoon said he had received draft testimonials that none of the suspects had signed to approve. He said the drafts needed further revision before they were sent to court.

The lawyer said that he set the revision deadline for this Sunday and that the documents would be submitted to the DSI the following day. He also said he would bring 200 witnesses, including direct sales and pyramid scheme experts, to the DSI on Monday to offer testimonials on the case.

Mr Witoon must give all evidence to the DSI by Dec 3, when the 84-day detention period expires. He said this is being done so the DSI can submit all evidence to the state prosecutor before the expiration date, as the suspects will need to be freed if no charges have been laid by then.

CNBC reports that many Americans are increasingly looking to emigrate following former President Donald Trump’s victory in the latest US presidential election. Many disappointed Americans are exploring information and options for moving to other countries.

Data from Google Trends in the US indicated a sharp increase in searches related to “leaving the country” and “how to move to...” as Trump’s return to the White House became increasingly likely.

On November 6, “how to move to Canada” became the most searched term on Google, particularly in Democrat-leaning states like Vermont, Maine, Oregon, and Washington. Meanwhile, “Can I move to another country?” became the top search in two Blue Wall states—Wisconsin and Pennsylvania—which consistently voted Democrat until becoming swing states. This search also surged in Oregon, Minnesota, and Indiana.

A pre-election survey conducted earlier this month by Casino.org, an online betting site, revealed that 21% of respondents were considering moving abroad if their preferred candidate lost. However, this number was considered more likely to reflect political disappointment than serious intentions to emigrate. Nearly 60% admitted it was “unlikely” they would actually move, and only 2.6% said they were “highly likely” to leave the country.

According to the survey, the top 10 countries Americans are interested in moving to are Canada, the UK, Japan, Australia, Italy, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland, Spain and France.

Several Asian countries also made the top 25, namely South Korea (ranked 21), the Philippines (22), and Thailand (23). Singapore came in at 28, Vietnam at 29 and Indonesia at 33.

The main factors influencing these choices were culture, followed by jobs, and healthcare system. Around 3% of respondents also considered tax policies and education systems.

The survey, which included more than 4,000 Americans aged 18-65, was conducted to gauge attitudes toward emigration following the 2024 US presidential election.

In addition, a national poll by NBC News in September revealed that two-thirds of Americans (about 67%) felt the country was on the wrong track, down from 73% in January this year.

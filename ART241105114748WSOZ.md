KBTG, in partnership with King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL), Mahidol University (MU), and Thammasat University (TU), has introduced a graduate-level initiative through KBTG Kampus. This programme aims to deepen Thailand’s tech education by fostering practical research and studies addressing real-world industry challenges. Through this collaboration, KBTG strengthens its role as a leader in Thailand’s rapidly advancing tech landscape.

KBTG Kampus, first launched in 2022 to address the gaps in Thailand’s technological education, initially collaborated with KMITL to develop undergraduate programmes and lay a solid foundation for tech education. Expanding on this, KBTG now offers master’s programmes developed alongside top universities, integrating practical research applications in data analytics, artificial intelligence, and cyber security. The three new programmes are:

1.  Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence for Business Analytics - King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang
2.  Master of Science in Cyber Security and Information Assurance (International Programme) - Mahidol University
3.  Master of Arts and Science Programme in Interdisciplinary Studies - Thammasat University

KBTG will actively participate in selecting students and supporting them throughout their studies, providing a robust path for tech talent development and reinforcing its position in Thailand’s IT sector. A recent MoU signing ceremony with MU and TU highlighted this commitment. For programme details and applications, visit [KBTG Kampus](https://kbtgkampus.tech/).

The KBTG Kampus initiative includes three key programmes:

1.  KBTG Kampus ClassNest – Bootcamps developed in collaboration with top institutions, where KBTG offers scholarships and potential career opportunities for graduates. Since 2024, over 1,000 participants have engaged in seven bootcamps.
2.  KBTG Kampus Apprentice – Hands-on experience for university students working on real projects at KBTG. The apprentice programme has extended to the master’s level, providing advanced, professional experience.
3.  KBTG Kampus Co-Research – A collaborative research programme with universities and private sector partners, aimed at driving innovation and deep tech research to create impactful products.

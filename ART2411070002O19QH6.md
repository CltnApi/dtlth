For more than two decades, the turmoil in the southern border provinces has persisted, significantly impacting the mental well-being of numerous children and young people.

In an effort to bring back joy and happiness during the upcoming New Year and National Children's Day 2025, Central Group, in partnership with the Royal Thai Army and various allied organisations, is proud to continue the initiative "Million Gifts, Million Smiles â€“ From The Hearts To The Smiles" for its 15th consecutive year.

They warmly invite the Thai community to participate by sending gifts or educational support to children and youth in the southern border provinces and beyond through multiple channels provided by Central Group.

Over 48,000 youth households in the southern border provinces are currently experiencing financial hardships, with some children left orphaned. This situation has led to significant barriers in accessing education for these young individuals.

In response, the Million Gifts Million Smiles initiative, launched by Central Group in partnership with the Equitable Education Fund (EEF), encourages contributions to educational funds aimed at alleviating the financial strain on parents.

This effort seeks to address educational disparities for youth in the southern border provinces and Tak province, while also fostering sustainable career and income opportunities for families in the long term.

The Royal Thai Army will facilitate the transportation of gifts and educational funds, which will be distributed to children during the upcoming Children's Day celebrations.

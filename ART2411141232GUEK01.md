Ms Thapanee Kiatphaibool, Governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, commented, “The Ministry of Tourism and Sports, through the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), has been actively collaborating with the Ministry of Culture, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, and numerous public and private sector partners to elevate Thailand's profile as a world-class event hub. By transforming traditional Thai festivals into global attractions and drawing in international music and sports events, we aim to extend tourists' stays, increase tourism spending, and stimulate economic growth.

Thailand’s strong tourism sector, strengthened by robust private sector partnerships, has earned the prestigious 'Destination of the Year 2025' award from Travel + Leisure. The Amazing Thailand Countdown 2025 at ICONSIAM exemplifies this global recognition. This world-class event, a product of robust public-private collaboration, reinforces Thailand’s position as a premier countdown destination. TAT extends our gratitude to ICONSIAM and all partners for their invaluable contributions to this achievement.”

Sanon Wangsrangboon, Deputy Governor of Bangkok, added, “The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) is committed to establishing a creative and cultural hub to drive sustainable economic growth. While the government plays a vital role in facilitating various initiatives, the private sector is truly the driving force behind these successful projects. The collaboration between public and private sectors is critical to the city’s economic development. The Amazing Thailand Countdown at ICONSIAM is a globally renowned event, attracting both domestic and international tourists, and boosting Bangkok’s tourism, particularly during the year-end high season. As a partner in this event, the BMA prioritises public safety and has deployed fire engines, fireboats, and personnel to ensure swift response in emergencies. This allows everyone to celebrate safely and happily during the festive season.”

**Driving Tourism Growth Through Unforgettable Countdown Experiences**

Dr Kitsana Vachekrilas, Secretary General of the Thai Chamber of Commerce and Board of Trade of Thailand, shared, “Thailand is renowned as a top tourist destination, particularly during the year-end holiday season. This period is essential for the tourism industry, generating substantial revenue and economic benefits. The TAT projects a 20% rise in international arrivals, reaching approximately 12 million visitors and generating 652,826 million baht in revenue in the last four months of this year, reflecting a 29% increase. This underscores the vast potential of Thailand's tourism industry. The Thai Chamber of Commerce is committed to collaborating with all sectors to ensure the success of the Amazing Thailand Countdown 2025, creating unforgettable experiences for visitors and showcasing Thailand's capabilities in hosting world-class events. This will boost economic confidence and support SME growth along the Chao Phraya River.”

Cdr Parinya Ruckwatin, RTN., Chairman of the Chao Phraya River Tourism Association, noted, “The Amazing Thailand Countdown 2025 is set to be our largest and most impressive celebration to date, drawing visitors from around the world. This year, businesses along the Chao Phraya River, including hotels and restaurants, have made extensive preparations to welcome both domestic and international tourists, enhancing safety measures to ensure a world-class experience. The association anticipates an overall revenue increase of more than 75% for businesses along the river during this festive season, with a projected growth exceeding 100% on countdown night.”

Mr Apichart Patcharapinyopong, Chairman of the Thai Boats Association, highlighted, “This festive season has seen a remarkable increase in activity, especially with the arrival of the Amazing Thailand Countdown 2025.

To manage the expected surge in passengers along the Chao Phraya River, ferry services at ICONSIAM have been extended until 3:00 AM on countdown night to ease traffic congestion and provide visitors with greater convenience.”

From addressing travel is life in the previous year, travellers are 'rewriting their playbook' in 2025; defying the rules of conventional getaways, and as a result, forging new connections with themselves, their loved ones, those they meet along the way, as well as the destinations they visit.

To understand how people plan to break away from the status quo, Booking.com commissioned research among more than 27,000 travellers across 33 countries and territories to present nine travel predictions which foresee 2025 being the year that ushers in new ways of experiencing the world – from millennials rethinking the airport experience to thrill-seeking boomers.

**1\. AI = Alternative Itineraries**

Technological advancements and new innovations play a pivotal role in shaping the travel experience in 2025. From planning trips tailored to individual preferences to discovering unique and off-the-beaten-path destinations, AI is set to enhance how travellers immerse themselves in their journeys.

83% of Thai travellers (66% of global travellers) plan to use technology to gather information and experience authentic local culture.  
Over 75% of them utilize technology to discover less crowded destinations, such as secondary cities or hidden gems.  
More than 54% of Thai travellers express interest in using AI to curate various aspects of their trips.  
To cater to this trend, Booking.com has introduced the "AI Trip Planner", an AI-powered tool designed to provide personalized travel recommendations and inspire new possibilities for travellers.

**2\. Multigen Megatrips**

In 2025, adults are shifting from leaving monetary inheritances to creating lasting memories with their families through travel. A notable emerging trend is "SKI" (Spending Kids' Inheritance), which focuses on using savings to provide meaningful travel experiences for younger generations rather than saving it solely as a financial inheritance.

Nearly 40% of Thai travellers (46% of global travellers) prefer spending money on "once-in-a-lifetime" trips in 2025 over saving it as an inheritance.

This trend is particularly popular among Baby Boomers, with 96% of Thai Baby Boomers willing to cover travel expenses for their children and grandchildren on their next family trip.

Additionally, over 78% of Thai travellers acknowledge that their parents have financially supported family vacations, even after they've reached adulthood.

As cost-of-living challenges persist and family dynamics evolve, travel has become a shared reward for hard work. It not only creates cherished new memories but also strengthens family bonds. In APAC, multigenerational households are 43% more common than the global average\*\*. Families enjoy travelling for reunions or special occasions, seeing these moments as a chance to unite and celebrate milestones together, with a duration between 4 to 6 days to avoid travel fatigue.

Millennials often take the lead in planning family trips, driving 48% of travel arrangements with their tech-savvy approach.

Yet, it's not a one-person show — Gen Zs are eager to chip in, with 47% co-planning and personalising itineraries.

Baby Boomers, on the other hand, tend to take a backseat, with only 23% actively involved in planning.  
Accommodation choices are as varied as the families themselves. Hotels remain the go-to for 40% of families, with resorts following as the preferred option for 52%. And around 10% of families are drawn to culturally immersive stays.

**3\. Vintage Voyaging**

The growing popularity of second-hand shopping has extended its influence into the travel world. In 2025, travel wardrobes and accessories are set to embrace a more vintage style, reflecting a shift towards sustainability and individuality.

76% of Thai travellers are more interested in purchasing clothing during their trips rather than before they travel, with interest among Gen Z rising to 81%.

Over 53% of Thai travellers are keen to visit second-hand clothing shops while travelling.

An impressive 88% of Thai travellers have previously purchased vintage or second-hand items from abroad.  
This trend isn't just about fashion or style. It's also driven by rising living costs and climate concerns, standing in opposition to fast fashion and consumerism. Travellers are embracing second-hand shopping during their trips as they seek affordability and unique experiences.

82% of Thai travellers (68% of global travellers) plan their spending carefully, finding joy in the hunt for hidden gems in thrift shops.

Additionally, 45% of them believe that second-hand items from vintage shops abroad are of higher quality compared to those available locally.

**4\. Noctourism**

Escaping the heat for cooler environments has long been a favourite among Thai travellers, as seen in the Cool-captioners trend that came up in 2024's travel predictions where interest in water-centric activities was high on the list to beat the heat. In 2025, they are increasingly embracing nighttime adventures, drawn by cooler weather, the serenity of less crowded spaces, and a growing fascination with space and the universe.

73% of Thai travellers (62% of global travellers) are eager to visit dark, peaceful destinations, with many keen on nighttime activities:

85% dream of stargazing under a star-filled sky.  
81% want guided tours focused on astronomy to learn about celestial maps.  
74% are interested in discovering constellations and their locations.

Climate concerns, rising temperatures, and sunlight exposure also influence travel decisions, making nocturnal explorations even more appealing.

68% of Thai travellers plan to include more nighttime activities in their itineraries to avoid the heat of the day.  
Sun protection is a top priority, with 75% scheduling activities during early mornings or evenings to minimize UV exposure.

Over 73% prefer booking eco-friendly accommodations in natural settings with minimal artificial lighting, ensuring a serene atmosphere while reducing light pollution, which benefits the environment and wildlife.

5\. Passport to Immortality

Since travellers search for the elixir of life, the year 2025 marks a shift toward travel for longevity, as both Thai and global travellers increasingly value wellness tourism. For them, travel is not just a time to relax but a golden opportunity to enhance their quality of life, rejuvenate their bodies, and embrace a healthier, more youthful way of living.

81% of Thai travellers (58% of global travellers) are willing to "buy health" through travel, prioritizing trips focused solely on relaxation.

6\. Boyz II Zen

The year 2025 signals a progressive shift in social perceptions, particularly around masculinity and traditional "macho culture." The emphasis on alcohol, cigarettes, and bravado is diminishing, replaced by a focus on wellness, self-improvement, and emotional growth. For many men, travelling has become a means to reduce loneliness and strengthen bonds with friends while addressing internal struggles. Their key motivations include reducing daily stress (31%), relaxation and recovery (42%), finding inner peace and improving mental health (28%), and personal development (29%).

62% of Thai travellers (47% of global travellers) support men-only trips that prioritize self-care and connection. This perspective is particularly strong among Gen Z (66%) and Gen Y (68%).

**7\. The Gate Escape**

In the past, travellers often rushed to arrive just in time for their flight, aiming to avoid crowds at the airport lounges. However, by 2025, the trend has shifted to a more relaxed approach, where travellers are open to spending time enjoying new entertainment options available at airports before their flights. Next year, Thai travellers are moving away from the typical stressful airport experience and are instead embracing convenient, enjoyable stopovers. The shift reflects a new mindset, where even layovers can become a delightful part of their journey.

82% of Thai travellers stated that they would feel much better and less stressed about their trip if there were more amenities and entertainment options available at the airport.

73% of Thai travellers expressed interest in visiting unique and interesting landmarks or attractions within the airport.

77% of Thai travellers prefer airports with distinctive facilities that provide an experience, rather than those lacking such offerings.

The driving force behind this shift is largely attributed to Gen Z and Gen Y travellers, with 75% of them considering airport amenities as an important factor when choosing their travel destinations. Key features they are particularly interested in include capsule hotels at airports, airport spas, or Michelin-star restaurants.

Michelle Gao, Regional Manager for the Mekong and China at Booking.com, said, "In 2025, travellers will be using their trips to transform themselves, their relationships and ultimately the world around them. A growing proportion of men are seeking getaways that challenge outdated gender expectations and foster mental well-being. And almost one in five boomers are refusing to let age keep them from chasing down new adventures. It's all about breaking travel norms to foster a deeper sense of connection. At Booking.com, we truly believe that technology and imagination are coming together to create a new era of travelling and ultimately make it easier for everyone to shape their own journeys in 2025 and beyond."

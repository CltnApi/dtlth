The Hope Fair will kick off the holiday season with a pop-up Christmas market featuring bespoke selections by over 100 local and regional partner vendors, in the Ballroom of Avani Sukhumvit Bangkok Hotel, tomorrow from 11am to 8pm.

This is a good time for artisans, entrepreneurs, charities and culinary experts to show up and assist those looking for perfect stocking stuffers, holiday decor, festive specialties or even show-stopping gifts.

The Hope Fair prides itself on curating a market with meaningful, creative products that are produced in small batches and even made by hand. Whether it is homeware goods, creative jewellery, elegant accessories, artisanal goods, tempting pastries, tasty snacks or succulent delights, visitors can find something festive to enjoy for themselves or as a special gift to others.

This year's market also marks the Hope Fair's 10th Christmas with its community of vendors and guests and it will see Santa Claus coming to town to sing Christmas classics, meet families and fill the air with holiday cheer at 3.30pm. Also, children from the Mercy Centre will come a carolling to show their appreciation for Hope Fair's support.

Since its inception, the Hope Fair has donated over 1 million baht to the Mercy Centre. Those funds have gone to repairs in the school and caring for the blind, senior citizens and school-aged children.

Visitors are also invited to contribute to the Centre by bringing donations such as gently-used clothes and household items, which will be collected and distributed to those in need.

There is no admission fee. Visit thehopefair.com.

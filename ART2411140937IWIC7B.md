Crystal Home, Thailand’s premier distributor of luxury bathroom products, recently collaborated with AXOR, the German bathroom brand renowned for its high-end design, to host an exclusive workshop at Soho House Bangkok. Themed The Power of Colours, the event attracted top architects, designers, and media representatives for an inspiring session on using vibrant hues in luxury bathroom spaces.

Mrs. Suthipa Svasti-Xuto (centre), Director of Crystal Home, welcomed attendees alongside Mr. Olivier Sogno (3rd left), Business Unit Leader AXOR and Vice President of Corporate Marketing at Hansgrohe Group. Highlighting AXOR's commitment to personalisation, Sogno introduced the celebrated AXOR One Collection, designed in collaboration with the Barber Osgerby studio. This collection, with its bold yet sophisticated colour palette, offers a fresh approach to bathroom design, empowering clients to express individuality. Attendees were treated to insights from Edward Barber, one of the designers of AXOR One, who shared the creative inspirations behind the collection and its journey to becoming one of AXOR's most popular offerings.

The evening concluded with engaging discussions, allowing designers to explore how AXOR’s products could transform bathroom spaces into personalised sanctuaries of luxury and style.

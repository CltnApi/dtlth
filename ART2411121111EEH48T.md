According to the [Verdant Planet](https://www.verdantplanet.org/) website, a Phayre’s langur’s fur turns blueish-grey and light brown in the belly when they are three months old. Also, female Phayre’s langurs are larger than their male counterparts.

These elusive primates can be found in the canopies of tropical rainforests, mixed deciduous forests and bamboo forests. Their arboreal lifestyle helps protect them from predators.

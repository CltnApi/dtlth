Agriculture is a key profession for the Thai people, and Thailand is one of the world's major food producers. However, Thailand's agricultural sector is currently facing several challenges, including unpredictable weather conditions and the rising average age of the agricultural workforce.

**Unveiling the strategy of strengthening collaboration with partners in three key areas:**

Chia Tai's solution is the result of collaboration with partners to strengthen three key areas. These include Chia Tai’s leadership in the agricultural input market, with extensive expertise in products such as seeds, fertilizers, and plant protection products, which are combined with autonomous agricultural technologies from XAG, including unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and smart steering systems. Additionally, the integration of agricultural machinery from Yanmar S.P., such as seeders and tractors, allows farmers to cultivate more efficiently, saving labor and time, while also enhancing precision agriculture.

“Farmers who have experienced Chia Tai’s solutions shared with us that this year marks the first time in their farming careers that they didn't have to work the rice fields themselves. With the help of labor-saving machinery, their fields are well-maintained. XAG Thailand by Chia Tai, provided a drone team to offer guidance on drone operation for precise spraying of agricultural inputs, which proved to be more accurate than manual labor. This also saved a significant amount of time. The resulting rice yield was of high quality, and most importantly, their family and young generation returned to help with farming, fostering pride in the agricultural profession,” Ms. Supaporn added.

PM tackles disputed sea area

Paetongtarn: Cabinet to see plan soon

The government expects to form a Joint Technical Committee (JTC) in the next two weeks to negotiate issues related to overlapping maritime area ownership dispute with Cambodia, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said.

She said on Tuesday that the plan will go before the cabinet in the next two weeks.

The JTC will resume talks with Cambodia over the Overlapping Claims Area (OCA) in the Gulf of Thailand based on the 2001 memorandum of understanding.

However, she also admitted that previous governments had unsuccessfully established JTCs to resolve the disagreement.

According to government sources, Defence Minister Phumtham Wechayachai will lead the JTC.

Although Mr Phumtham, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, refused to comment Tuesday, he agreed that it was customary for a JTC chairman to be a deputy prime minister in charge of national security.

Mr Phumtham also insisted that "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the National Security Council and relevant agencies have confirmed the MoU is the best mechanism \[for resolving the dispute\]".

Thailand and Cambodia have both claimed sovereignty of the OCA, covering 27,000 square kilometres in the Gulf of Thailand.

Cambodia made its first maritime claim in 1972, which Thailand rejected. The following year, Thailand made its counterclaim.

Both countries signed the MoU agreement in 2001 to establish a joint development regime over certain OCA areas and attempt to demarcate a maritime border.

The 2001 MoU between Thailand and Cambodia grabbed public attention after observers pointed out that if the document is used as the basis for negotiations on managing marine resources in the overlapping claims area, the Thai government risks losing sovereignty over Koh Kut.

Key figures of the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP) held a press conference last week to oppose discussions on the joint development of oil and gas resources in the Gulf under the 2001 MoU framework, which they argue could result in Thailand losing territory.

Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala, former finance minister and PPRP chairman of an academic committee, argued the MoU includes a territorial claim by Cambodia that contradicts the 1907 French-Siamese treaty, rendering the MoU itself illegal.

The government has said that talks have yet to begin.

Suphanvasa Chotikajan Tang, the director-general of the Department of Treaties and Legal Affairs, said that once the cabinet approves the JTC, it will be forwarded to parliament for endorsement.

Ms Suphanvasa said that the JTC will comprise officials from the Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Energy Ministries as well as legal experts from the Council of State as part of a flexible mechanism that will help negotiations go smoothly.

She said negotiations over the OCA will cover joint natural resource development and maritime security issues. Therefore, the government has also set up two separate panels to work on both issues.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will lead a panel working with Cambodia's own JTC on maritime security and the sea border, while the Energy Ministry will lead a panel working on joint natural resources development.

"Negotiations will seek the mutual consensus between both countries. The cabinet must approve the outcome of the negotiations. Importantly, the result must be in line with international law and other legal frameworks," she said.

Ms Suphanvasa also insisted the 2001 MoU would only be used as a framework for negotiations and was not a threat to national interests, as critics claimed.

She said Article 5 of the MoU clearly states that the memorandum and its implementation should not affect either party's maritime claims.

SYNNEX (Thailand) Public Company Limited, Thailand’s leading importer and distributor of IT products and services, has partnered with COPPERWIRED Public Company Limited and Siam Paragon to launch Southeast Asia’s first Nintendo Authorised Store by SYNNEX. Situated in the heart of Bangkok, this flagship store promises to offer an immersive gaming experience through strategic collaboration among key industry leaders. The synergy between these partners is set to enhance competitiveness, meeting the growing demand in the gaming market while addressing evolving consumer needs. 

This milestone is a significant step in SYNNEX’s expansion of its gaming portfolio. By focusing on superior service and experience, the store aims to align with the lifestyles of modern consumers, contributing to long-term sustainable growth. 

In 2023, SYNNEX entered the gaming industry by securing the rights to distribute Nintendo Switch products in Thailand. The company’s integrated business expansion strategy, coupled with the Trusted by SYNNEX label, has built consumer confidence and received positive market responses, further solidifying its position. 

Ms Sutida Mongkolsuthree, Chief Executive Officer of SYNNEX (Thailand), remarked: "We recognise the potential of the Nintendo Switch portfolio. Our customer-centric approach emphasises certified products, convenient access, and valuable after-sales services. With over 32 million gamers in Thailand, representing 47% of the population, we are confident that this new store will meet the needs of consumers and elevate their gaming experience." 

Adding to the concept, Mr Paramate Rienjaroensuk, Chief Executive Officer of COPPERWIRED, highlighted the store’s design: "Consumers today prioritise informed decisions and seek products that match their lifestyles. The Nintendo Authorised Store by SYNNEX reflects this through its strategically designed zones. The Experience Zone allows customers to explore gaming before purchase, while the Merchandise Zone features iconic Nintendo character-themed products, making shopping seamless and enjoyable." 

The store’s location at Siam Paragon strengthens its appeal. With a daily footfall of 150,000 to 200,000 visitors, Siam Paragon is a global destination renowned for delivering exceptional lifestyle experiences. 

Ms Saruntorn Asaves, First Executive Vice President of Siam Piwat, said: "Siam Paragon attracts visitors from around the world, offering unparalleled experiences across generations. Partnering with SYNNEX and COPPERWIRED ensures the Nintendo Authorised Store by SYNNEX will benefit from our combined expertise and drive growth rapidly." 

The Nintendo Authorised Store by SYNNEX, located on the 3rd floor of Siam Paragon, officially opens on 22 November 2024. For more information, visit Facebook: SYNNEX Thailand.

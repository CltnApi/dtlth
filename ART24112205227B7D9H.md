An event being held on the sidelines of the 29th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan, the Thailand Pavilion invites visitors to exchange knowledge on climate change mitigation.

The brainchild of the Natural Resource and Environment Ministry and related agencies, the Pavilion showcases Thailand’s progress in mitigating climate change in terms of policy, technology, action and finance.

The technology and innovation zone highlights a heat index detector for addressing heatstroke, a major  risk to Thai people during the summer. The detector plays an important role in notifying people in areas at risk of high temperatures to suspend outdoor activities.

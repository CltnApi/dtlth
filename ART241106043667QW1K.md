This season, Anantara Siam Bangkok Hotel’s renowned Italian restaurant, Biscotti, unveils an exclusive chef residency, welcoming Italy’s celebrated Cristina Bowerman from the Michelin-starred Glass Hostaria in Rome. From 6th November to 30th December 2024, Bangkok diners will have the rare chance to experience Chef Bowerman’s contemporary Italian cuisine, redefining traditional fare with a creative twist that reflects her passion for cultural heritage, memory, and innovation.

Chef Bowerman is a culinary powerhouse in Italy, earning one Michelin Star and the prestigious three Forks from Gambero Rosso for her acclaimed restaurant, Glass Hostaria. Since its opening in 2006, Glass has garnered numerous accolades for its avant-garde approach, blending tradition, research, and experimentation. Supported by her longstanding team, Edoardo Fortunato and Davide Grieco in the kitchen, and Riccardo Nocera in front of house, Chef Bowerman has created a unique space in Rome that is more than a restaurant—it’s an experience. 

**A Unique Menu Crafted for Bangkok** 

During her residency at Biscotti, Chef Bowerman will present an exclusive menu of signature dishes from Glass Hostaria alongside creations tailored for Bangkok. Highlights include **Almost A Pizza**, a creamy celery root pizza with pomegranate molasses; **Sea and Earth Tartare**, featuring beef and tuna tartare with apple and caviar; and **Amberjack Sashimi**, a refreshing take with amberjack in red beet juice and beet miso. Pasta and risotto selections showcase her inventive interpretations, such as the **Liquid Parmigiano Reggiano Ravioli** with seasonal truffle— a Glass signature for over 13 years—and **Beef Tenderloin with Chocolate Demi Glace**, paired with grated foie gras torchon. Guests can also indulge in **Waila with Pastrami Pigeon Breast**, served with a BBQ leg and berry drops.

Born in Cerignola, Puglia, Chef Bowerman moved to Rome in 2005, joining the Michelin-starred Convivio Troiani before taking the helm at Glass Hostaria. Her dedication to sustainable cuisine has earned her recognition in the Michelin Guide’s global Green Initiative and inclusion by Forbes in 2023 among Italy’s 100 most influential women. As a member of the Chefs' Manifesto, she advocates for sustainable agriculture and is an Ambassador for Rise Against Hunger Italia. Bowerman’s commitment to sustainability extends to her restaurant, one of the first to earn Plastic Free certification. 

**A Year of Global Culinary Excellence at Anantara Siam** 

Biscotti’s chef residency is part of Anantara Siam’s commitment to bringing international culinary talent to Bangkok. The hotel has hosted New Delhi’s Indian Accent (No.26 on Asia’s 50 Best), three Michelin-starred chefs Jimmy Lim of JL Studio, and Viki Geunes of Zilte. Anantara Siam’s bar, Aqua, has also featured top guest bartenders from the World’s 50 Best Bars. 

Cristina Bowerman’s residency at Biscotti will run from 6th November to 30th December 2024, open Monday to Saturday for lunch from 12:00 pm to 2:30 pm, and Monday to Sunday for dinner from 6:00 pm to 10:30 pm.

Taiwanese innovation will take centre stage at the Taiwan Expo 2024 which will take place at Hall 5 of Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre (QSNNC), Ratchadaphisek Road, starting Thursday until Saturday, daily from 10am to 6pm.

Held under the theme "Explore Tomorrow Innovations", the three-day event will bring cutting-edge products and solutions from over 170 leading Taiwanese companies, covering five key areas -- Smart Manufacturing, Smart Medical, Smart Lifestyle, Circular Economy and Culture and Tourism.

It also presents one-on-one business matchmaking sessions for those looking for new business opportunities, as well as industry forums to foster trade and collaboration between Taiwan and Thailand.

The expo is packed with 10 themed pavilions and the highlight is the Taiwan Excellence Pavilion, which serves as a platform for exceptional Taiwanese products, rigorously vetted for their quality, design and innovation.

On show will be 58 of Taiwan's most prestigious Taiwan Excellence award-winning products, offering visitors an exclusive preview of the future of health, sustainability and technology.

The diverse selection of innovations on display span key sectors such as Smart Living, Sustainable Solutions, and Information and Communications Technology. From immersive three-dimensional vision to state-of-the-art air purification and smart living advancements, these products are designed to enhance everyday life.

Also, curious consumers and seasoned industry professionals are invited to interact with Taiwan's top innovators, experience their "Best Made In Taiwan" products and enjoy a memorable encounter with Fu Bear, a lively Taiwanese black bear mascot who will make his official debut in Thailand at the expo.

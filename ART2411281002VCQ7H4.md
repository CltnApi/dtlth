In an era of rapid global change, societies face increasingly complex challenges influenced by diverse factors. In Thailand, social issues such as the rising number of missing persons among elderly individuals with Alzheimer’s disease are becoming more pressing. In 2022, approximately 770,000 elderly individuals were reported to have dementia. Vulnerable groups, including over 300,000 individuals with autism, further highlight the need for tailored solutions. Additionally, human-wildlife conflicts, particularly involving wild elephants, have impacted over 156,066 households annually, causing damage to agricultural land, injuries, and fatalities.

**Decoding the Equation of “Tech for Good”** 

**A Blend of Technology, Insights, and Profound Understanding** 

Innovation is a key driver of sustainable progress, and True Corporation, a leading technology company in Thailand, is committed to becoming an innovation-driven organisation. Through its “Tech for Good” philosophy, the company is creating solutions that bring meaningful benefits to society. 

Mr Veerasak Pongtanyavichai, Head of the Innovation Centre, True Corporation Plc, explained: "The core mission of True Innovation is to nurture people with the mindset of innovators—creating solutions that bring sustainable value to Thai society and consumers. Our strategy lies in the equation of ‘Tech for Good,’ which comprises three main drivers:" 

1.  **Empathy: Understanding Life in All Dimensions** 
    

Developing technology that responds to the needs of humans and other living beings through a human-centric approach, informed by community insights. 

2.  **Insights: Data Power Driving Change** 
    

Making decisions based on comprehensive data analysis, incorporating insights from partner networks to develop precise, evidence-based solutions that ensure real-world impact. 

3.  **Technology: Innovation for All Lives** 
    

Leveraging telecommunications expertise, AI, and Big Data to create accessible solutions that enhance the quality of life sustainably. 

**True’s Innovation Highlights** 

**Tackling Human-Wildlife Conflicts with Technology** 

Wild elephants rank as the 8th most dangerous animals to humans globally, according to BBC Science Focus Magazine. In Thailand, their population of over 4,000 is projected to grow by 8% in 2024. Between 2012 and 2024, wild elephants encroached on communities, causing 198 injuries and 227 fatalities. 

To address this, True Corporation developed the **True Smart Early Warning System**, integrating 5G, AI, and camera traps to provide real-time alerts via the Smart Adventure app. Piloted since 2018 in collaboration with the Department of National Parks and WWF Thailand, the system has reduced the impact of human-elephant conflicts from 74% to just 0.36%. 

**“Since 2019, we’ve issued over 5,754 alerts about wild elephants approaching communities. This technology has been critical in enhancing safety and mitigating damage,”** said Mr Sakda Luangsakultong, Head of True Lab, True Corporation Plc. 

**Innovations Driving Social Impact** 

**Autistic Application** 

True Corporation, in collaboration with the Autistic Thai Foundation, developed the **Autistic Application**, a tool designed to improve the physical, learning, and communication skills of individuals with autism. The app, which has been freely available for over a decade, features: 

*   **Daily Tasks****:** Encouraging routine development and self-reliance. 
    

*   **Trace & Share****:** Tracking progress and achievements. 
    

*   **Communication****:** Supporting Thai, English, and Chinese languages. 
    

The app has achieved 19 million downloads globally, with children in Thailand demonstrating significant developmental improvements. 

**“Hai Mai Huang” Wristbands** 

In partnership with the Mirror Foundation, True created QR code wristbands for individuals at risk of getting lost, such as those with dementia. Over four years, 3,000 wristbands have been distributed, helping to safely return 40 missing individuals to their families. 

"Simpler, cost-effective innovations often deliver the most impactful results," noted Veerasak Pongthanyavichai, highlighting True’s dedication to accessible solutions. 

By fostering a culture of innovation, True Corporation is paving the way for sustainable progress, with bold goals for 2030 to transform its workforce and the wider society. 

**Enhancing Customer Service with the “Mali” Innovation** 

In the economic dimension, True Corporation has transformed customer service through the introduction of **Mali**, an AI-powered solution. Handling over **2 million interactions monthly**, Mali achieves a remarkable **90% success rate** in resolving customer issues, significantly reducing the workload on human agents while ensuring faster service delivery. Only **10% of cases** require escalation to human staff, reflecting Mali’s efficiency and reliability. 

Mali began as a voice-based system and has since evolved into a **comprehensive, multi-channel solution**. Designed to cater to platforms such as **Voice, Chat, App****,** and A**I interfaces**, Mali ensures seamless and efficient customer support across all channels.

**Cultivating Innovators in True’s Innovation-Driven Organisation** 

True Corporation fosters a culture of innovation through a structured approach encompassing three key dimensions: 

1.  **Closed Innovation** 
    

Encouraging the development of a creative culture within the organisation, True supports employees in generating innovative ideas to enhance products and services, driving continuous improvement and value creation. 

2.  **Open Innovation** 
    

True collaborates with academic institutions and business partners to co-create and scale innovations. These partnerships integrate diverse expertise and resources, enabling transformative solutions. 

3.  **Startups** 
    

True invests in nurturing new-generation entrepreneurs and young talents, empowering them to establish impactful startups and develop high-potential businesses. 

"True Innovation believes that people are the most critical drivers of creativity and progress within an organisation," said Mr Veerasak Pongtanyavichai, Head of the Innovation Centre, True Corporation Plc. 

Over the past three years, True employees have developed over **600 innovations**, with more than **4,000 employees** recognised as innovators. The organisation has also successfully submitted over **100 intellectual property filings**, collectively generating or saving over **4 billion THB** in revenue and costs. 

Looking ahead, True is committed to further advancing this success. By **2030**, the company aims to have **50% of its workforce recognised** **as innovators** and secure **200 innovation patents**, reinforcing its dedication to cultivating a culture of innovation and excellence.

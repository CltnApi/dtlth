The acquisition of La Fabrique du Temps in 2011 took Louis Vuitton's watchmaking to the next level. Subsequently, development of showstoppers included the colourful Escale Worldtime, launched at Baselworld 2014.

Instead of a sophisticated complication, Louis Vuitton marks Escale's 10th anniversary with a collection of time-only, three-hand watches that celebrate the art of travel and trunkmaking heritage down to the last detail.

The four new Escale models are housed in a rose gold or platinum case with a diameter of 39mm.

Seamlessly set against the satin-brushed case middle, an octagonal crown is fluted on alternating sides and topped with a dome, echoing the shape of a trunk rivet and emblazoned with the Louis Vuitton Monogram.

The polished and satin-finished lugs resemble the angled form and riveted exterior of brass brackets and corners that reinforce the maison's travel trunks.

These brass elements are echoed on the dial with angled and riveted markers in polished gold at each quarter, holding together the outer minuterie and central dial.

The minuterie is punctuated with gold studs, recalling nails of the lozine that run along the exterior of a Louis Vuitton trunk. Final touches of a brushed finish and subtle concave camber lend the minuterie texture and readability against the silvery satin-finished tilted flange.

The two versions in rose gold differ with a silvery or blue stamped dial, whose texture is a direct reference to the finely grained surface of the Louis Vuitton Monogram canvas.

A striking platinum Escale boasts a dial in Gibeon meteorite, carefully selected to highlight contrasting textures and natural mineral tones of this otherworldly material, sourced from Namibia.

Baguette-cut diamonds sparkle on the case and bezel of the other platinum variation with a black onyx face.

Under the logo at 12 o'clock, "Paris'' pays tribute to how La Ville Lumi√®re has been home to Louis Vuitton's workshops since 1854. Inspired by finely tapered needles, the reworked hands reflect the savoir-faire in creating couture and leather goods.

The tip of the PVD coated titanium seconds hand is shaped to follow the curve of the dial, minimising the possibility of parallax error for precision in reading the time.

Technically, crafting the seconds hand in titanium rather than gold is one of the energy-efficient solutions to ensure the self-winding movement's power reserve of 50 hours. Moreover, calibre LFT023, revealed by the sapphire crystal caseback, is certified by the Geneva Observatory as a high-precision Swiss chronometer.

At the base of the dial, the phrase "FAB. EN SUISSE" is an allusion to the fine watchmaking at La Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton in Meyrin, Geneva.

Like how a Louis Vuitton trunk is identified by an engraved serial number plate, each timepiece comes with a serial number engraved on a slim cartouche on the periphery of the caseback.

The rose gold Escale with a silvery dial further expresses the heritage with its calf-leather strap accentuated by fine yellow stitching, reminiscent of classic Louis Vuitton leather goods.

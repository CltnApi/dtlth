Boncafe (Thailand) Co., Ltd. hosted the Boncafe Route to Root activity under the concept “Beyond the Beans” for its valued customers. The trip took place from 25–27 November 2024 at the coffee plantation, Na Thep Sadet Garden in Thep Sadet, Doi Saket District, Chiang Mai Province. Now in its third year, this event aimed to provide customers with an in-depth understanding of the coffee production process from upstream to downstream.

The trip enabled customers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the coffee production process, including cherry picking, washing, drying, polishing, roasting, and tasting. Participants observed the meticulous care and attention farmers put into producing the finest coffee for consumers. This year, Boncafe introduced a special feature: a visit to Fora Bee, one of Thailand’s premier bee farms and a valued partner of Boncafe. Renowned for its high-quality bee products, Fora Bee enhances the unique flavors of Boncafe’s coffee

In addition to activities for valued customers, Boncafe recognises the importance of supporting farmers and communities by funding research and establishing community learning centres through the Agricultural Research Development Agency (Public Organisation) and the Faculty of Engineering, Chiang Mai University. A learning centre in Thep Sadet, Doi Saket District, serves as a model for expansion to other communities, aiming to develop and add value to agricultural products in alignment with the BCG model.

Environmentally friendly activities remain a core principle for Boncafe. Participants were encouraged to reduce their carbon footprint by using tote bags instead of plastic bags and avoiding the use of plastic cups during the trip. This campaign promotes awareness and nature conservation alongside coffee education.

Furthermore, Boncafe is committed to environmental sustainability by advancing sustainable agriculture in the coffee industry. The company introduced Boncafe Rainforest Reserve coffee beans, certified by the Rainforest Alliance, sourced from high-quality coffee beans in Vietnam.

The antique villas near the Chao Phraya River were built in 1908 by Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath, the 43rd child of King Chulalongkorn (King Rama V).

They are currently under the care of Narisa Chakrabongse, a granddaughter of Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath. She told Krungthep Turakij in an interview that her grandfather used these villas for changing clothes before serving in the Grand Palace.

The villas were inherited by His Royal Highness Prince Chula Chakrabongse, the only child of Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath after his death, she explained.

Chakrabongse Villas highlight a classic-revival villa designed by Italian architect Mario Tamagno, Narisa said, adding that Tamagno was also responsible for the design of Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall in Dusit district.

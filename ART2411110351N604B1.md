Police arrested a popular fengshui master near Bangkok on Monday morning for alleged public fraud after complaints he had failed to deliver promised "auspicious objects"  that cost followers about 70 million in total.

One woman complained she had lost 60 million baht.

Thanawan Jiracharoenwes was arrested in Pathum Thani province, just  north of Bangkok, early on Monday.

Pol Maj Gen Montri Theskhan, commander of the Crime Suppression Division (CSD), said Mr Thanawan had several hundred thousand followers on social media.

He was detained under an arrest warrant approved by the Criminal Court  on a charge of public fraud and taken to CSD headquarters in Bangkok for questioning. 

Last week, at least 10 people filed complaints with the CSD, alleging they lost about 70 million baht in total they paid to the fengshui consultant, who advised them to end their bad luck by holding ceremonies and buying “auspicious objects" quoted at seven-digit prices. 

They said they did not receive many of the objects they ordered from Mr Thanawan.

The complainants included a 77-year-old woman who told police she alone lost about 60 million baht to the suspect.

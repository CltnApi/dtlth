At the Bangkok Remand Prison and the Central Women’s Correctional Institution on Monday, a team of special-case investigators from the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) issued additional charges against 18 individuals and one legal entity, all suspects in the iCon Group case.

The charges include violations under the Decree on Loan Fraud and Pyramid Scheme Offences, as well as breaches of the Direct Selling and Direct Marketing Act.

Pol Capt Wisanu Chimtrakun, DSI deputy director general, said these charges follow the National Police’s submission of cases related to public fraud and the Computer Crimes Act, after which the DSI accepted the case as a special investigation.

The DSI conducted further enquiries with the Fiscal Policy Office and the Office of the Consumer Protection Board (OCPB) regarding The iCon Group's business operations.

This led to sufficient evidence for issuing additional charges, specifically under one count of pyramid-scheme offences and two counts under the Direct Selling Business Act. These include operating a direct-sales business that promotes network participation and conducting direct sales without authorisation.

Wisanu confirmed that the pyramid-scheme offence is supported by evidence from the Fiscal Policy Office and OCPB, showing that the business operations involved illegal activities, such as the inability to deliver promised returns or genuinely circulate funds.

Investigators have also looked into the business' fraudulent methods, financial statements, fund-flow analysis, and back-end computer data, providing a comprehensive view of the case.

While the suspects argue that actual products are available, which they claim supports their business legitimacy, the DSI is open to considering any substantial evidence provided by their legal counsel.

As for the investigation involving celebrity executives charged with pyramid-scheme offences, Wisanu noted that while their roles may differ, each participant had specific duties within a coordinated process.

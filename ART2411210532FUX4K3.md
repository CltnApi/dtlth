Govt to ramp up its emissions targets

Thailand will aim to further reduce its emissions of harmful gases because the first global stocktake recognised by the Paris Agreement shows its efforts are falling short of the country's target to help control the rising temperature of the planet, says Minister of Natural Resources and Environment Chalermchai Sri-on.

Mr Chalermchai made the remarks in his address at the COP29 climate summit organised by the United Nations in Baku, Azerbaijan, on Tuesday.

The global stocktake has driven near-universal progress on climate action but the world is still not on track to meet the long-term temperature goal of the agreement, reach the necessary levels of resilience, or mobilise and align the required financial flows, observers say. The nationally determined contributions by each country (NDCs) that are to be submitted in 2025 -- also known as NDCs 3.0 -- are set to be informed by the outcome of the first global stocktake.

NDCs 3.0 must be more ambitious than the current NDCs and may be the last opportunity to get the world on track with a global emission trajectory in line with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting the rising global temperature to 1.5C a year, he said.

"We plan to reduce GHG \[greenhouse gas\] emissions to below 270 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent against the 2019 level economy-wide by 2035," Mr Chalermchai said.

"A comprehensive green investment plan will support the implementation of NDC 3.0 Additionally, we will boost the GHG sink in LULUCF \[land use, land-use change, and forestry\] by 120 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent by 2037," he added.

Mr Chalermchai said Thailand is among countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change.

"We have suffered record-breaking heat of 43 degrees Celsius, flash flooding due to heavy rainfall, as well as landslides, causing irreparable damage to our economy and livelihoods. This includes biodiversity loss such as seagrass, which would cause a decline in dugong populations of around 50% in less than six years,'' he said.

Thailand emits less than 1% of the world's greenhouse gases. Yet the government is determined to enhance its mitigation action, and uphold the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, to achieve our NDC 2030 goal by reducing GHG emissions by 222 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent in five sectors, Mr Chalermchai said.

Those sectors are energy, transport, waste, industrial process and product use, and agriculture, he added.

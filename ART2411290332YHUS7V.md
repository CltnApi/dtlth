Sikhio Smart Living: Redefining Thailand's Smart City Future

The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (MDES) and the Digital Economy Promotion Agency (depa) have showcased the achievements of the SIKHIO SMART LIVING project, which has transformed Sikhio into a fully-fledged smart city. The initiative focuses on enhancing safety, public service delivery, and urban data management, aiming to improve the efficiency of services and city management for citizens, society, and local communities. 

Assistant Professor Dr. Nuttapon Nimmanphatcharin, President and CEO of depa, stated that the SIKHIO SMART LIVING project, implemented through collaboration between MDES and depa, is centred on promoting the application of technology to improve public services, urban management, and community and social development in Sikhio District. depa has taken on a mentoring role, connecting the city with innovative solutions for urban development and enabling the integration of these technologies into practical city management practices. The project has prioritised development across three key dimensions: safety, public service delivery, and urban data management through the City Data Platform (CDP), all aimed at enhancing the quality of life for local residents. 

**Enhanced Safety** 

The project upgraded the software for all 52 CCTV cameras in Sikhio District, bolstering urban safety. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been integrated to detect vehicles and individuals based on attributes such as car colour, brand, type, gender, age range, and clothing colour. In the event of an incident, the system enables authorities to swiftly identify perpetrators. Additionally, a LINE Official Account (LINE OA) has been employed to facilitate the reporting of complaints and incidents. Over the project’s 180-day period, responsible agencies received more than 700 cases, with the most common issue reported being public lighting outages. This system not only expedited problem resolution for residents but also provided valuable data for city administrators to analyse, plan, and address recurring issues more effectively over the long term. 

**Improved Public Service Delivery** 

A Software Design Document was developed to enable efficient data exchange and integration within the city, reducing the workload for officials. This includes managing assets such as CCTV cameras, fire extinguishers, and streetlights. The system allows real-time problem tracking and resolution, enabling prompt and effective service delivery to the public. 

**Advanced Urban Data Management** 

A dashboard was created to consolidate and manage city issues such as electrical outages, damaged pavements, and waste management. This tool prioritises problem resolution based on urgency and frequency. Furthermore, an environmental data dashboard was introduced to provide insights into land use, vegetation height, and pet data, facilitating tasks such as procuring pet vaccines for public health services. The platform also incorporates welfare data for senior citizens and bed-ridden patients, enabling officials to locate and provide necessary assistance or medical services promptly. 

**A Model for Smart City Development** 

The SIKHIO SMART LIVING project serves as a model for smart city development in Thailand, underscoring the importance of active involvement from the city itself. This includes leadership with a deep understanding of urban development, the creation of policies tailored to the city’s needs, and alignment with its unique context. The ultimate objective is to enhance the quality of life for residents in a precise and sustainable manner.

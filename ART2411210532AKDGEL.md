Navy chief sending officers to JTC

The commander-in-chief of the Royal Thai Navy (RTN) is ready to send marine and legal officers to join the soon-to-be-set-up Joint Technical Committee (JTC) to negotiate with Cambodia to resolve the disputed maritime areas in the Gulf of Thailand.

Speaking after a ceremony commemorating the 118th anniversary of the RTN at its headquarters yesterday, Navy Chief Adm Jirapol Wongwit said the navy is responsible for overseeing the maritime border Thailand has designated. "We have been able to look after our maritime boundaries smoothly and without any border conflicts with our neighbouring country \[Cambodia\] because both parties understand each other," he said.

As the public is interested in the 2001 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) related to Thailand's overlapping continental shelf claims with Cambodia, the Naval Education Department will hold a seminar on Dec 3, he said. The seminar will cover maritime boundaries, agreements and disputes. It will be open to the public to learn about negotiation processes and legal procedures related to the International Court of Justice and maritime law.

"This will provide society with a clearer understanding of the various scenarios related to international agreements," he said. As for the progress in setting up the JTC, he said the navy is happy to support the government's efforts.

Defence Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said earlier the RTN's Hydrographic Department and various other agencies must participate in the JTC.

"We are happy to support this because we must also thoroughly study the maritime boundary issue. Hydrographic Department officials will have technical knowledge, but if it is a legal matter, we will send our representatives from the Office of the Judge Advocate General. It depends on which type of technical officials the JTC needs," he said.

Foreign Affairs Minister Maris Sangiampongsa spoke about the progress made in setting up the JTC, saying the government is considering adding more experts.

Russ Jalichandra, a vice-minister for foreign affairs, said cancelling the 2001 MoU would not nullify Cambodia's claim. Rather, the problem would remain, compounded by the lack of a mechanism for negotiations.

The MoU, a framework for talks, covers maritime zones and negotiations on the use or joint development of the claimed area. Both issues must be negotiated simultaneously and cannot be separated to avoid future problems, Mr Russ noted.

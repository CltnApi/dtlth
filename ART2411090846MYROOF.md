The government has appointed Umesh Pandey and Werapong Prapha as Thai Trade Representatives.

The order issued by the Prime Minister’s Office was signed by Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Nov 5 and took immediate effect.

Mr Pandey was a former editor of the _Bangkok Post_ before entering politics. He has served as an adviser to the Pheu Thai Party economic policy committee and last year was appointed a vice-minister to advise former premier Srettha Thavisin.

“I am humbled and honoured to be appointed to the new position today,” Mr Pandey said of his new position in a Facebook post on Nov 5. “I would like to thank Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and the entire cabinet in appointing me to be the new Thailand Trade Representative.

“I promise to do my best to help my country become the destination for investments. I look forward to interacting with all my contacts that I have built over nearly 3 decades of work life as a banker/journalist and now politician.”

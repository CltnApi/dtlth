Taipei: Thailand's Suteepat Prateeptienchai is one round away from a successful defence of his Taifong Open after he took a share of the third-round lead Saturday with his young compatriot Runchanapong Youprayong.

Suteepat, who also won the Yeangder TPC here in Taiwan in September, fired a four-under-par 68 at the par-72 Taifong Golf Club, while Runchanapong carded a 66.

They lead the US$400,000 event on 18-under 198, four shots ahead of Australian overnight leader Jack Thompson, who fell back with a 73, Thailand's Danthai Boonma, who scored a 65, Chonlatit Chuenboonngam, who posted a 68, and Taiwan's Hung Chien-yao, who had a 70.

Suteepat has made no secret of his love for Taiwan and he showed that again Saturday when after a slow start he moved through the field. He bogeyed the first hole but bounced back with five birdies.

The 31-year-old said: "I three-putted the first but holed a 15-footer for birdie on the eighth which was the turning point for me. I missed from six feet on the last to match my winning score of 19-under last year, but never mind.

"I have never defended a title before. It's big. I just need to make sure I create a lot of chances tomorrow."

Runchanapong, who is 23 years old and in just his second year as a professional, birdied the last three holes to set up the biggest Sunday of his fledgling career.

"I was only two under on the front nine but gave myself a lot of chances," said Runchanapong, who was coached in his junior days by this week's tournament director Krirkchai Boonprasert.

"I made a big birdie putt on 10 from 25 feet and then had that great finish. I am just going to play the course tomorrow not the other players. It's been great this week, the greens really suit me so that's why I have been holing putts."

Taiwan's Max Lee Chieh-po, currently in third place on the Asian Tour Order of Merit after his victory in the International Series Thailand, shot a 67.

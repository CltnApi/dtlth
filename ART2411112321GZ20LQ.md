Thailand national team coach Masatada Ishii addresses his players.

Thailand national team players reported for a training camp Monday to prepare for their upcoming Fifa Day matches against Lebanon and Laos.

The War Elephants are set to take on Lebanon on Thursday at Thammasat Stadium and Laos on Monday at the same venue. Thai Rath TV (Ch 32) will beam both matches live, starting 7.30pm.

Coach Masatada Ishii hopes to use these warm-up games to find new faces for next month's Asean Championship.

Ishii said: "I am happy that none of the 23 players selected for these two friendlies has opted to pull out of the squad.

"I have already made it clear to everyone that I intend to use these two matches to test players ahead of the Asean Championship.

"The reason that I have been watching the Thai League 2 and 3 games is because I want to see young players for our future assignments.

"We also have seasoned players like Suphanat Mueanta, Supachok Sarachart, Ekanit Panya and Sarach Yooyen, who do not have any club commitments during the Asean Championship, to strengthen the team."

Big boost for Angels

Bangkok United have moved six points clear at the top of Thai League 1 following a 3-2 victory over Khon Kaen United on Sunday night.

Richairo Zivkovic put the Angels ahead in the ninth minute before Bassel Jradi added the second on 32 minutes. Hosts Khon Kaen got their first goal in the 41st minute from Jakkit Palapon, but Muhsen Al-Ghassani netted again before break for Bangkok United.

Also on Sunday, Buriram United were held to a 1-1 draw by Rayong.

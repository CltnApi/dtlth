The Thai government’s determination to spur investment in satellite development and space infrastructure was highlighted at the opening of **Thailand Space Week** 2024 on Thursday.

The event, touted as Southeast Asia’s largest [international event for space technology](https://tsw.gistda.or.th/), is taking place at Impact Muang Thong Thani until Saturday.

Prasert Jantararuangtong, the minister of Digital Economy and Society, highlighted the country’s ambition to make Thailand Space Week 2024 a world-class gathering, advancing space technology, business and regional growth.

“This event marks a key milestone in Thailand’s drive to integrate space technology into our economic and societal development,” he said in a keynote address.

“By embedding space technology into essential sectors, we are preparing Thailand to be a leader in the new S-Curve economy.”

He underscored the event’s role in promoting private-sector adoption of space technologies.

He said youth engagement also remains a government priority, with its policy on educational programmes and hands-on activities designed to prepare future generations for careers in space and technology.

Thailand Space Week 2024 is organised by the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (Gistda) under the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, in partnership with over 70 organisations, including the Cabinet Office of Japan, Ispace, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, PTT, Siemens, Thaicom, among others.

Pakorn Apaphant, the Gistda executive director, said that Thailand Space Week, now in its third year, aligns with the ministry’s vision to strengthen the country’s science and innovation landscape.

He said the event is expected to draw over 3,000 participants from 34 countries, with over 100 exhibition booths. This year’s theme is “Converging Technologies, Connecting People”.

By showcasing the latest in space innovation, the event serves as a vital platform for networking and knowledge exchange among global leaders, including representatives of CNSA (China), Kari (South Korea), Ostin (Singapore), Mysa (Malaysia), QZSS (Japan) and Philsa (Philippines), he said.

Thailand Space Week 2024 continues through Saturday, inviting local and international participants to explore partnerships, expand networks and unlock the economic potential of Thailand and the region.

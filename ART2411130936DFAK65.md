Taiwan Excellence brought together over 100 dedicated volunteers for the Day of Giving project, a corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative focused on uplifting communities and protecting the environment. Aligned with Taiwan Excellence’s mission to support impactful CSR activities annually, this year’s Day of Giving emphasised environmental conservation and community empowerment. Volunteers learned innovative methods to turn waste into resources, helping to reduce pollution, safeguard natural water sources, and create sustainable income for local communities.

The project proudly received a carbon-neutral certificate, awarded through the Greenhouse Gas Management Organisation’s carbon footprint calculation tool. Through energy-saving initiatives and eco-conscious activities, such as the Water Dragon Activity (offsetting 15.39 kg of CO2 per person) and the Beach Cleaning and Marine Waste Upcycling Activity (offsetting 14.85 kg of CO2 per person), the project successfully offset 4 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

Thailand generates approximately 27 million tonnes of waste each year, averaging 1.14 kilograms per person per day. Taiwan Excellence launched the Day of Giving project to address the pressing issue of waste in Thailand. This project aims to increase public awareness and understanding of waste management, featuring two impactful activities: Building Water Dragons – Protecting Our Rivers Activity and the Beach Cleaning and Marine Waste Upcycling Activity for Sustainability. These activities drew over 100 volunteers who actively participated in learning, creating, and supporting sustainable community practices.

The Water Dragon Making Activity in the Wat Jak Daeng Community, Samut Prakan Province, focused on creating floating trash traps—or "Water Dragons"—from recycled materials like used plastic bottles and foam. These trash buoys prevent waste from travelling through canals into rivers and ultimately to the sea, effectively capturing over 2,000 tonnes of trash per year. This initiative reduces marine waste by up to 30 percent, mainly capturing plastic bags, which amount to over 98 million pieces annually.

In addition to addressing water pollution, the Beach Cleaning and Marine Waste Upcycling Activity partnered with the community enterprise group in Ban Amphoe, Chonburi Province. Volunteers helped collect waste from the beach, learned about waste management practices, and participated in upcycling activities, creating valuable products from waste. Examples include plant pots and coasters from plastic bottle caps, floor bricks from glass bottles, and oil from waste materials. This initiative helps generate income for the community while sustainably conserving the ocean and its marine life.

Bangkok Life Assurance Public Limited Company has unveiled a renewed vision grounded in “Caring,” launching a brand campaign to become “The Most Caring Insurance Brand” and drive sustainable growth. Mr. Chone Sophonpanich, President and CEO, emphasised that “Caring” has long been a cornerstone of the company’s mission, shaping its life and health insurance products, the BLA Every Care programme, and interactions with clients, agents, and financial advisors. Customer insights reveal that “Caring” is the top attribute associated with the Bangkok Life brand.

“We are committed to positively impacting all stakeholders, including customers, agents, employees, and society, as we strive to embody caring in all our endeavours,” Mr. Chone remarked. This enhanced vision includes exceptional customer service, innovative technology, and solutions designed to meet the needs of every generation. For agents and advisors, Bangkok Life offers professional development, fostering a caring culture that extends to all client interactions. Internally, the company promotes a supportive work environment based on equity, inclusion, and good governance. 

Bangkok Life is also deeply committed to community well-being, advocating financial literacy, healthy lifestyles, and environmental responsibility through efforts toward carbon neutrality and resource management. As Mr. Chone noted, “Our mission to care extends beyond business to positively impact society and the environment, creating a foundation for sustainable growth.”

Ms. Onranat Nachapong, Senior VP of Marketing Strategy, noted that the campaign aims to resonate with younger generations, aligning with insights that highlight “Caring” as a valued quality in after-sales support. The “Caring” campaign will feature two commercials—one focused on family bonds and another on services like “Driving Home” and “Home Health Care”—launching on November 13 across various media to emphasise the brand’s commitment to genuine care. 

Bangkok Life Assurance aims for the campaign to inspire viewers to embrace caring as a foundation for happiness and community well-being, keeping the brand at the forefront of the industry with its promise to become “The Most Caring Insurance Brand.”

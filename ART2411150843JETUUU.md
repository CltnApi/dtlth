EC explains new Provincial Administrative Organisations poll date

The election of chairs and members of Provincial Administrative Organisations (PAOs) will be held on Saturday, Feb 1, instead of Sunday, Feb 2, in a bid to ensure the vote runs smoothly given the legal limitations outlined in the election law, EC commissioner Santhat Siriananpaiboon says.

According to the current rules, an election must be held within 45 days of the end of the PAO members' term. As the incumbents' term will end on Dec 19, an election must be held no later than Sunday, Feb 2 next year.

Holding the election on Saturday, Feb 1, will allow authorities more chance of wrapping up the entire process by Feb 2, as required by law, said Mr Santhat, adding the EC opted not to hold the election on Jan 28 to give candidates more time to campaign.

Authorities also need time to prepare and examine the candidates' eligibility, he said, noting candidate verification takes up the most resources during elections.

Mr Santhat urged officials to do their best to ensure a fair and transparent election.

There will be more than 90,000 polling stations in the Feb 1 election.

The election will be organised by local authorities, with the EC responsible only for setting the date and providing support and assistance.

Candidate applications will be accepted from Dec 23-27.

The Feb 1 elections, however, will not take place in all provinces. This is because some provinces have already held their PAO polls to find replacements for members who had resigned or were removed from their posts.

EC secretary-general Sawang Boonmee yesterday called on incumbent PAO chairs who are planning to resign before their term ends on Dec 19 to remember the 45-day requirement.

Mr Sawang also urged officials to maintain transparency and comply with the rules in managing the polls and handling complaints.

The EC secretary-general voiced confidence that the polls will be fair and transparent.

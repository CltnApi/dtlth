BDMS Wellness Clinic's Innovative Fertility Technology Defrosts Couple’s Challenges

Pregnancy eligibility has recently been extended to women born in 1976 or later, thanks to the adoption of assisted reproductive technology in fertility treatment.  

**Extending the Shelf Life of Eggs?** 

Modern women nowadays delay having children due to their lifestyle, work or education. As a result, natural conceiving becomes more difficult and comes with higher risks. Late pregnancies, often assisted by technologies such as IVF and ICSI, come with increased risks for both mother and baby, making planning and treatment essential. 

When women are ready to have children at older age, fertility challenges may occur due to a decrease in both quantity and quality with an increase in abnormality of eggs. Additionally, modern lifestyles can contribute to these difficulties. Even if conception is successful, there is a higher risk of fetal abnormalities. 

Egg collection is no longer exclusive to couples. Modern culture and Western influences encourage young women to make independent choices. Eggs can now be frozen indefinitely without losing their original quality for single women in the future when they are ready to have a child. With an initial fee of 200,000 baht for two years of storage, the renewable fee is only 1,500 baht per egg per year, and the contract can be terminated at any time. 

**The Recipe for Success: A Blend of Fertility Treatment and Preventive Medicine** 

Our fertility treatment associated with medical integration of preventive medicine is a breakthrough concept to provide deep investigation and advance preparation for enhancing sperm and egg quality in order to achieve a higher pregnancy rate.  

Fertility & Women Wellness Clinic at BDMS Wellness Clinic is one of the fertility institution in Thailand offering the ‘best laid plan’ for an expecting couple with tailor-made treatment protocol such as health preparation before fertility treatment and pregnancy, personalised supplements, nutrition adjustment, and exercise program.  

IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) and ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) are advance reproductive treatments, involving four key stages: ovarian stimulation and egg collection, fertilization, embryo culture, and embryo transfer. 

Preimplantation Genetic Screening by using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, is a process designed to analyse all 24 chromosomes of embryo stage day 5 or 6 (known as ‘blastocyst’). We offer this test in some indicated cases such as women aged over 35, recurrent miscarriages, repeated implantation failure (RIF) and history of fetal abnormalities. 

“Thailand is among the countries that have recently adopted Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), a technology that screens embryos for genetic abnormalities before implantation so we can transfer normal with good quality embryo to significantly increase pregnancy rate and reduce miscarriage rate” said Dr. Chalomkwan Prayoonwech, M.D., Director of the Fertility & Women Wellness Clinic and Specialist in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, BDMS Wellness Clinic, Bangkok. 

“With an expanded window of opportunity, our Fertility and Women Wellness Clinic has welcomed many patients over 40 years of age. Many couples already have children but wish to add another member to their family. Other cases involve parents with genetic abnormalities hoping to avoid passing these to their child, as well as those who have experienced RIF.” 

With our advance technology IVF laboratory, we provide time-lapse embryo culture, in which the embryo is monitored real time and exposed to least intrusive risks. Additionally, Endometrial Receptivity Array (ERA) is a technique to determine implantation window of individual for doing embryo transfer at the proper time. 

 “Apart from technology advancement, preparation is key. Unlike the practices of 20 years ago, patients are now advised to prepare their bodies at least two – three months before beginning fertility treatment, for the highest success rate as possible” reinforced Dr. Chalomkwan Prayoonwech.  

Supported by significant investment in medical laboratories, infrastructure and a reliable telemedicine network, Fertility and Women Wellness Clinic at BDMS Wellness Clinic has attracted many patients from across the world. These patients can receive a tele-consultation to prepare from their home country and then come to the clinic at their readiness. We also provide wellness hotel, the Mövenpick BDMS Wellness Resort Bangkok, located in Bangkok’s CBD next to the clinic where nursing and nutrition teams are following cases with appropriate recommendations.  

BDMS Wellness Clinic is committed to progressing fertility advancement through the scientific learning curves and discovery as a journey of life has never been easy. Beyond successful pregnancy, strong and healthy next generation is a parent’s highest goal.

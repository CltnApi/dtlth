The Meteorological Department has issued a warning for severe thunderstorms affecting the southern region, anticipating torrential rain, gusty winds and rough sea conditions from Thursday to Saturday. 

According to the weather forecast, 12 of the 14 provinces along the Gulf of Thailand and Andaman Sea will experience harsh weather, with only Ranong and Phuket exempt from the warnings. 

The agency reported that waves in the gulf could reach heights of at least two metres and warned of potential landslides and mudslides in mountainous and hilly areas due to the heavy rainfall.

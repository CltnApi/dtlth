The Dragonfly H.E.A.L. (Harmony, Empathy, Acceptance, Love) Summit 2024 concluded after two days in Bangkok, engaging over 2,000 attendees with renowned speakers, immersive experiences, and networking opportunities. 

[Dragonfly](https://dragonfly360.co/summit/), a leading platform in Asia for catalysing social change, announced a new leadership academy and retreat in Bali, building on the summit’s success. This event gathered thought leaders, changemakers, and wellness advocates worldwide for a journey of self-discovery, connection, and impact. 

Notable speakers included British entrepreneur Steven Bartlett, who shared insights on personal growth in his talk, Leading with Purpose: Entrepreneurship, Innovation, and Personal Growth, urging attendees to “balance time between the trench and the clouds.” Roxie Nafousi, a personal development expert, presented her 7 Steps to Manifesting Your Best Life, encouraging the audience to explore self-worth as the foundation for manifestation.

Dragonfly also announced its upcoming five-day leadership retreat in Bali, from 30 November to 4 December 2024, in collaboration with Elevation Barn. This retreat will focus on personal grounding, purpose clarity, and skills for impactful leadership, guided by Bali’s top wellness experts. The Dragonfly Academy will offer a curriculum centred on wellbeing, leadership, and inclusivity, supporting leaders in fostering inclusive, resilient teams. Notably, Thailand faces a significant mental health challenge, with 20% of adults experiencing mental health issues annually, according to the Asian Development Bank. The summit, retreat, and academy aim to reduce these challenges through corporate wellness initiatives and leadership empowerment.

**DBS Denla British School,** a leading International School in Thailand, is delighted to announce the launch of the prestigious **Pandejpong Awards,** designed to recognise and support high-achieving students in the Sixth Form. These awards reflect DBS’s unwavering commitment to fostering academic excellence and preparing students for success at the world’s leading universities.

The Pandejpong Awards are funded by a generous endowment from the Pandejpong family as a tribute to the Pandejpong family’s longstanding dedication to education for over 46 years, which began with the establishment of Denla Kindergartens. The Pandejpong Awards are a **100% tuition fee discount, valued up to THB 2 million,** scholarship for students in Year 11 enrolling in the Sixth Form at DBS.

DBS Denla British School is a part of the Denla Group with an Enhanced British Curriculum adapted from the renounced UK Independent school curriculum. Since its founding in 2017, DBS has rapidly become one of the top schools in Thailand, known for its rigorous academic standards and holistic approach to student development. The Pandejpong family’s passion for education remains at the core of DBS, shaping a school where academic achievement and personal growth are equally prioritised.

In launching the Pandejpong Awards, **Mr Arn Pandejpong,** Chairman of the Board of Directors at DBS Denla British School, remarked, "It is an honour to continue our family’s legacy in education through the Pandejpong Awards. These scholarships represent our commitment to providing outstanding students with the opportunity to realise their academic potential and become future leaders. We firmly believe that a world-class education is the key to unlocking success, and we are proud to offer this support to talented young people."

**The Pandejpong Awards for Sixth Form (Years 12-13)** are aimed at attracting the highest calibre of students, preparing them for entry into leading global universities. The award offers a **100% tuition fee discount, valued up to THB 2 million,** for up to three students and in addition, successful candidates would also meet the criteria for the school’s Sixth Form **scholarship package worth up to THB 250,000 per scholar,** which scholars can spend on scholarship related activities such as university visits, research projects and anything that will support them on their journey to top universities. Through this award, DBS seeks to foster an academically driven atmosphere in the Senior School, provide students with the resources and support needed to secure places at prestigious universities.

This is the time when students truly focus on their academic goals and prepare for university. By funding this award for Sixth Form students, we aim to support their ambitions and give them every opportunity to reach their highest potential. Through the Pandejpong Awards, we are investing in a generation of students who will represent DBS on the world stage and contribute positively to society.”

Pandejpong Scholars are expected to maintain the highest standards of academic achievement, behaviour, and leadership. They will also benefit from unique development opportunities, including academic competitions, enrichment programmes, and specialised university guidance. With the launch of the Pandejpong Awards, DBS further strengthens its commitment to providing an exceptional education that equips students to excel at the world’s most prestigious institutions.

**Mrs Sawanee Pandejpong,** reflecting on the inspiration behind the awards, shared: "As someone who grew up with very limited resources, I know the transformative power of education. I feel grateful for my family who supported me throughout the full education even though we had very limited resources. That experience taught me how vital education is to changing one’s future. My hope is that the Pandejpong Awards will open doors for students who face challenges similar to mine, giving them the opportunities they need to achieve their dreams and make a meaningful impact in the world.”

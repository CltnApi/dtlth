Arrest warrants have been issued for Dr Boon Vanasin, founder of Thonburi Healthcare Group (THG), and eight others on charges of public fraud and money laundering. While six individuals were arrested, Dr Boon has fled abroad.

The Metropolitan Police Bureau (MPB) on Friday obtained court approval for the arrests, including those of Dr Boon, 86; his wife Jaruwan, 79; and their daughter Nalin, 51. They are accused of misleading people into investing in medical businesses. The physician is also alleged to have forged his former daughter-in-law's signature to secure a loan, resulting in damages estimated at 7.5 billion baht.

The Criminal Court approved the arrest warrant for Dr Boon, citing collusion in public fraud, fraudulent borrowing, money laundering and violations related to bad cheques. Similar charges were filed against the other suspects. From December to October, 527 complaints were lodged against Dr Boon at the Huai Khwang police station by victims who were unable to cash cheques he issued.

Between Feb 2 and 4, Dr Boon reportedly built credibility by promoting five medical-related projects, including a cancer centre and hospital developments in Thailand and other countries, to attract investments. Initial interest payments were made, but subsequent payments were missed, leading to cashing issues with the investors' cheques.

As investigations continue, six suspects have been apprehended, while Dr Boon, his wife, and daughter remain at large, with the THG founder having reportedly fled on Sept 29.

On Friday, police arrested two women linked to Dr Boon's network at a law firm in Bang Bua Thong district, Nonthaburi. They were also charged with public fraud and fraudulent borrowing. Police identified them only as 38-year-old Siriwimol and Jidapha, 53. Seized from them was a Mercedes Benz.

Pol Maj Gen Theeradet Thammasuthee, commander of the MPB's Investigation Division, said the fraud case caused huge damage as many victims had been lured into investing with Dr Boon.

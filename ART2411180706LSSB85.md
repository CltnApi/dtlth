**Dr. Raweewat Maschamadol, Executive Chairman of Master Style Public Company Limited ("MASTER"), operator of Masterpiece Specialty Hospital and a leader in the beauty industry across Thailand and Asia, stated that** MASTER GROUP was dedicated to significant expansion within Southeast Asia, a high-potential market for cosmetic surgery and specialised medical care. The region is witnessing growing purchasing power and an increasing demand for beauty procedures among younger generations, driving rapid growth in service demand. Expanding into new markets such as Indonesia, Laos, and Cambodia is a key milestone in solidifying regional leadership and reinforcing MASTER's commitment to providing international-quality services. **MASTER aims to establish itself as the hub for cosmetic surgery in Southeast Asia.**  

“We are seeing strong growth in the regional market, fuelled by robust economic potential and increasing demand from both medical tourists and local populations, who are showing a growing interest in cosmetic surgery and beauty procedures. This trend is particularly evident in countries like Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand, where high-purchasing-power populations are increasingly turning to cosmetic surgery. We have successfully expanded our customer base and seen remarkable growth in our international clients, thanks to collaborations with influencer networks and online marketing channels, which have played a key role in building recognition and trust in MASTER as the go-to regional hub for cosmetic surgery. Our focus remains on integrating advanced medical techniques and modern technologies into our services, while continuing to expand our network of business alliances to drive growth and strengthen our regional competitiveness,” said Dr. Raweewat.

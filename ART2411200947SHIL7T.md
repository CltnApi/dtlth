Huawei Cloud and DTGO Corporation Limited (DTGO), a leading business group focused on social and environmental impact, have unveiled the world’s first large language model (LLM) designed for efficient performance in Thai, Chinese, and English. This groundbreaking innovation, DTLM, was launched on 18 November 2024 and developed using Huawei Cloud’s Ascend AI computing service. It aims to revolutionise business functions such as management, customer service, and data analysis for organisations across Thailand. 

As the first native Thai foundation model, DTLM addresses Thailand's linguistic needs by delivering precise language understanding and tailored Q&A functionality for Thai-speaking users. It surpasses open-source alternatives, providing superior optimisation and enhanced Thai language processing capabilities. 

By leveraging Huawei Cloud’s advanced AI solutions, DTGO overcomes industry challenges, achieving innovation and superior performance across the three languages. Huawei Cloud’s scalable infrastructure and commitment to low-latency performance have been critical to DTLM’s development. 

**Advanced AI Capabilities Supporting DTGO’s Mission** 

Huawei Cloud's Ascend AI service provided DTGO with powerful, ready-to-use computing resources to efficiently train and deploy DTLM. The service ensures real-time, high-quality performance while optimising resource investment. 

Victor Luo, Director of Solution Architect at Huawei Cloud, emphasised the significance of the collaboration:   
“Huawei Cloud will fully support DTGO in advancing AI in Thailand and realising the potential of the world’s first Thai-capable language model. Together, we are empowering Thai businesses and communities with high-performance intelligent technology.” 

Huawei Cloud’s Cloud Native 2.0 vision and recognition as a global leader in cloud container management reflect its commitment to continuous innovation and customer-centric strategies. Its advanced multi-level recovery and tool chain capabilities enable rapid iteration and stable operation, ensuring minimal downtime and maximised performance for DTLM. 

**Impact and Applications** 

DTLM has demonstrated superior results on the MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) standard, setting a new benchmark for Thai language processing. Currently integrated into DTGO’s customer service systems, the model supports internal functions and applications across government, sales, and retail sectors. 

DTGO operates under a business-social integration model, creating communities of talented, compassionate individuals committed to positive societal contributions. The deployment of DTLM strengthens DTGO’s mission to support Thai-speaking communities, drive business efficiencies, and enhance customer experiences.

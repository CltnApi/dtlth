No Brics membership for kingdom yet

Thailand has not yet been confirmed as a member of the Brics international organisation, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).

Speaking yesterday, ministry spokesman Nikorndej Balankura said that the Thai government is still weighing the economic benefits of joining Brics before the matter is considered in the House.

Brics comprises nine member countries, namely Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia.

According to the MFA, Foreign Affairs Minister Maris Sangiampongsa was appointed by Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra to attend a series of Brics meetings in Kazan, Russia, on Oct 24 at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

At this meeting, Thailand reaffirmed its determination to elevate its engagement with Brics, as stressed in a letter expressing its interest in joining the bloc as a full member in June, the MFA said.

When asked about a recent report saying that Thailand was being approved by Brics on Oct 24 as its official partner, Mr Nikorndej said that the MFA saw the report in question after Mr Maris attended the Brics Plus Summit in Kazan. Still, the ministry has yet to verify the news because it was published on the Brics news page on X and many other channels.

According to a post on the BRICS News account on Oct 24, "BRICS decides not to accept any new members as full members of the alliance for 2024. 13 new nations have been accepted as official partner countries and will be part of BRICS initiatives. They are working towards becoming full alliance members at a later date".

The post also listed Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, the UAE, Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia as the "Full BRICS Members".

It also listed Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, Uzbekistan and Vietnam as "Official BRICS Partner Countries".

Mr Nikorndej said: "According to the normal procedure, we must receive official notification from the Brics chair, which is Russia. We hope that we can be a Brics partner, but I cannot verify that it is true until the ministry receives the official confirmation document from the chair."

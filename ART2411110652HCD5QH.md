Oumar “Reug Reug” Kane warned Anatoly Malykhin he is coming for his light heavyweight MMA title next after dethroning ONE Championship’s heavyweight king on Saturday in Bangkok – with Senegal’s President even sending his congratulations.

The 32-year-old Senegalese wrestler took a close split decision in the main event of ONE 169 at Lumpinee Stadium, handing Malykhin the first defeat of his career.

A knockdown early in the fifth round appeared to be decisive, with two of the three ringside judges giving Reug Reug the nod on their scorecards based on damage criteria.

Russia’s is keen on an immediate rematch to reclaim the title, but may have to put one of his other two belts on the line instead. 

“I’m just going to fight for the 100kgs \[light heavyweight title\] so if ONE is going to bring me, I’m going for that,” Reug Reug told the Bangkok Post, when asked at the ONE 169 post fight press conference who his first heavyweight challenger would be.

The title fight had originally been slated to happen inside a cage at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, before the event was moved to Thailand due to “partner obligations”.

With no fence to fall back on, Malykhin struggled to match Reug Reug’s strength in the Lumpinee ring, with the African landing a takedown in the first round. 

Malykhin was also penalised early on for repeatedly grabbing the ring ropes as he tried to keep himself upright, referee Herb Dean showing him a yellow card.

“Even at his house, it would be fine,” Reug Reug quipped, when asked if the result may have been different in the ONE Circle.

“Anatoly was a cheater, you know. I tried to take him down and he grabbed the ropes. He went to grab my gloves throughout the fight. I think he was playing mind games with the referee.”

The main event duo had almost come to blows twice during fight week, first during a media session and then on stage at the ONE 169 press conference at the W Bangkok hotel.

Malykhin had repeatedly mocked his opponent, promising a “headshot” and boasting on the scale it would be “easy work, easy money” after making weight on Thursday. 

“People who were saying that I’m the underdog, they don’t really know me,” said Reug Reug, who lives and trains in Dubai. 

“I trained six months really hard for this, and I knew that I was going to beat him.”

The hard work paid off, with Reug Reug now expected to be welcomed by the country’s top officials and when he returns to his country of birth.

President Bassirou Diomaye Faye congratulated Reug Reug in a post on social media later on Saturday, with the title victory becoming national news.

“Congratulations to Oumar Kane, AKA Reug Reug, for making history by becoming the first Senegalese MMA heavyweight world champion,” Faye wrote.

“Through his courage, determination and talent, he honours Senegal and inspires an entire generation. Our nation is proud of his remarkable feat.”

Her Majesty will lead the parade as Commander of the Royal Guard's Combined Forces while Her Royal Highness Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana Rajakanya will serve as the Commander of the Royal Guard's cavalry battalion. The ceremony will be preceded by a military performance featuring over 300 army, navy, and air force personnel.â€‰Pool photo

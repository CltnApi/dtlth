To celebrate the 120th anniversary of its founding in the final years of the reign of King Rama V of the Chakri Dynasty, Siam Society presents a special musical performance titled 1907: Rama V European Operatic Journey at its auditorium. There are four rounds at 7pm on Nov 26, 28 and 30 and a matinee show at 4pm on Dec 1.

The show draws inspiration from the well-known Far From Home royal correspondence collection, a book of letters written by King Chulalongkorn to his daughter, Princess Nibha Nobhadol, while travelling across Europe in 1907.

Alongside fascinating details on European culture at that time, the book reveals accounts of the king's visits to theatres, where he attended seven operas.

Audiences will retrace his steps and journey into the world of early 20th century European opera through scenes from the seven operas -- La Traviata, Cristo Alla Festa De Purim, La Gioconda, Fortunio, The Merry Widow, Ariane and Madama Butterfly.

Each of them will challenge the skills of the artists and musicians in their vocal and dramatic display, ballet, and orchestral performance, masterfully interwoven into two acts lasting over two hours.

The production reinterprets each opera to resonate with modern sensibilities, while a newly-constructed runway stage will bring the audiences closer to the performers, enriching the musical and lyrical beauty, and emotional depth of the storyline.

The enchanting experience of operatic art and music will be brought to life by a talented ensemble of over 50 artists and musicians. The cast includes Singaporean baritone Martin Ng, Chinese soprano Mu Yu and Thai conductor Voraprach Wongsathapornpat, with Tarin Prinyaknit as stage director and choreography and narration by Darren Royston.

Tickets cost 2,000 baht and can be purchased from thesiamsociety.org.

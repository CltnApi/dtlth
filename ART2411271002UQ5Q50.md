Hylife Group has launched its **Hylife Global Foods** facility, a state-of-the-art 400-million-baht investment poised to revolutionise the food processing industry. Scheduled to open on **10 December 2024** in Chiang Mai, the facility integrates advanced technologies to promote environmental sustainability, align with global standards, and foster long-term growth while benefiting local communities.

**Sustainability at the Core**

According to **Mr Shubhodeep Das,** CEO of Hylife Group, the facility represents a 422-million-baht investment designed to meet international standards while prioritising energy conservation. **Hylife Global Foods** specialises in fresh, ready-to-eat, and processed fruits and vegetables, including dried fruits, chocolate-coated treats, and flavoured crispy rice snacks. Innovative processes, such as vacuum processing and extended shelf-life techniques, ensure high-quality products with preserved nutrients.

The plant’s sustainable initiatives include a **999-kilowatt rooftop solar panel system,** projected to reduce energy costs by USD 1 million over 20 years and cut carbon emissions by 1,000–1,200 tonnes annually. This system generates **carbon credits**, a first for the food processing industry. The company is also pursuing carbon footprint assessments for its products (CFP) and operations (CFO), with the goal of achieving carbon neutrality.

**Innovative Waste Management**

The facility employs cutting-edge **wastewater treatment systems** combined with biogas energy production. High-efficiency biogas digestion transforms wastewater into renewable energy, generating up to **500 kWh of electricity daily**. Treated water is repurposed for agricultural use during droughts, supporting sustainable farming practices and minimising water pollution.

Additionally, Hylife Global Foods has committed to **eco-friendly packaging** and a zero-waste policy, recycling or repurposing all production by-products. “We are fostering a circular economy by sourcing raw materials and labour locally, training farmers, and certifying agricultural produce to strengthen community resilience,” said **Dr Bundit Jumras,** CEO of Hylife Global Foods.

**Expanding Markets**

Hylife’s marketing strategy balances **domestic and international sales**, with 30–40% targeted for the Thai market and 60–70% for exports. Products will be available in leading Thai supermarkets and convenience stores, while international distribution focuses on key markets including the **US, Middle East, and Japan,** with plans to expand to **Europe, Russia, and China** by the end of 2025.

“We aim to establish partnerships with global retailers to further our reach while ensuring mutual development with local communities,” stated Mr Das.

The new facility is located at **287 Moo 17, Doi Lo Subdistrict, Doi Lo District, Chiang Mai,** and will officially open its doors on **10 December 2024**. This milestone marks a significant step towards achieving sustainable growth for Hylife Group and the communities it serves.

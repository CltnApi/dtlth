**The Thai Tuna Industry Association and the Fishing Net Association (Thailand)** have reaffirmed their commitment to sustainable fishing practices and local sourcing by signing a second memorandum of understanding (MoU) on Sunday.

The agreement aims to purchase more than 50,000 tons of O-fish (black O-fish, O-lai-O-tube) from Thai fishing boats operating in Thai waters, valued at about 2 billion baht.

This collaboration, witnessed by the Department of Fisheries, underscores the industryâ€™s dedication to supporting local fishermen and adhering to international sustainability standards.

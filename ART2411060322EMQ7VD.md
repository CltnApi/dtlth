Phothalai Leisure Park Co., Ltd., led by CEO and Founder Mr. Anan Tavisaengsiri, has introduced the state-of-the-art Track Man 4 system at Phothalai Golf Driving Range, enhancing the range to an 18-hole course standard. This launch coincides with the "Phothalai – Singha Thailand PGA Virtual Golf Tournament 2024," Southeast Asia’s first virtual golf tournament, supported by the Professional Golf Association of Thailand and Boon Rawd Brewery Co., Ltd.

Mr. Anan commented, "The upgrade of Phothalai’s driving range to meet 18-hole standards provides both professional golfers and enthusiasts with a space to practice and refine their skills. This development aligns with the post-COVID focus on health and wellness, which has spurred a growth of over 25% in our business. The Track Man 4 system, connecting to more than 300 virtual golf courses globally, further establishes Phothalai as a leader in the modern golf market and enhances the player experience with immersive, high-tech gameplay. Phothalai’s driving range is now certified by the Professional Golf Association of Thailand as Thailand's first and only virtual range capable of simulating a complete 18-hole course." 

The tournament attracted over 60 professional golfers, competing for prize money exceeding 350,000 baht, with Pro Khosit Khunwong taking the championship title. Phothalai also added excitement with longest drive and closest-to-the-pin challenges. 

“This investment highlights our forward-looking approach in sports and wellness, promising new revenue streams and promoting Thailand’s sports tourism,” added Mr. Anan.

**Ms. Cynthia Kiang, Director-General of International Trade Administration, Ministry of Economic Affairs (TITA),** stated: "With the global shift in supply chains, Thailand, with its strategic location, favourable investment climate, strong domestic market, and increasingly competitive industrial clusters, has become a key destination for foreign investment. Taiwan’s strengths in semiconductors, smart manufacturing, smart healthcare, and green technology align perfectly with Thailand's goals for industrial transformation. Through Taiwan Expo, we hope to deepen industry collaboration, assist Thailand in achieving industrial upgrades, and expand economic, technological, cultural, and social exchanges between Taiwan and Thailand to create more win-win opportunities."

**Mr. Chang Chun-Fu, Ambassador of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Thailand,** emphasised the longstanding friendship and close economic cooperation between Taiwan and Thailand. "Taiwanese companies investing and establishing manufacturing bases in Thailand have contributed jobs and technical expertise. In the educational sector, exchanges are growing, with the number of Thai students in Taiwan quadrupling and Taiwanese students in Thailand growing sixfold over the past decade. With a solid foundation of cultural and tourism exchanges, Taiwan and Thailand are poised to be ideal partners in creating a smarter, greener future together."

**Mr. James Huang, Chairman of Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA),** described Taiwan Expo as a leading platform for showcasing Taiwan’s strengths in both technology and innovation. “The spotlight on smart manufacturing this year highlights solutions such as digital monitoring, AI-optimised scheduling, carbon inventory tools, eco-friendly processors, and carbon management systems, all of which support Thailand’s journey toward net-zero transformation and address global climate change challenges. Furthermore, the circular economy is crucial for Thailand’s sustainable industrial growth. Taiwan’s expertise in recycling technology, resource reuse, and sustainable packaging will provide Thailand with valuable solutions and offer opportunities for technical collaboration, industry integration, and talent development.

The smart healthcare sector is another key focus, with several Taiwanese hospitals, including Changhua Christian Hospital, Shuang Ho Hospital, and Taipei Wanfang Hospital, presenting specialised medical services. A smart ward scenario zone has been created in partnership with Taiwan’s medical technology companies, illustrating future healthcare environments that could help Thailand’s healthcare system meet the needs of an ageing population, improve service quality, and alleviate pressure on the medical system.

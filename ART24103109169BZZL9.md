Embark on 'Culinary Compass': A Waterside Journey Through Time and Taste

Bangkok Marriott Marquis Queen's Park presents Culinary Compass: A Journey Through Time and Taste, a distinctive multi-venue dining experience at Asiatique The Riverfront, Bangkok’s heritage-rich dining, retail, and entertainment hub by the Chao Phraya River. This immersive culinary journey takes guests across four waterside dining venues—Sirimahannop, Asiatique Ancient Tea House, The Crystal Grill House, and The Siam Tea Room—each showcasing exceptional cuisine and historical charm. 

Guided by a planisphere, an ancient tool used by maritime explorers to navigate by the stars, diners will embark on a four-course adventure. Each course is served at one of the four unique venues, creating a seamless culinary journey inspired by the spirit of exploration. 

The experience begins aboard Sirimahannop, a reimagined tall ship permanently docked at Asiatique The Riverfront. On the ship’s elegant wooden deck, guests can enjoy a signature cocktail or mocktail with house-cured salmon on tom yum rice crackers and smoked duck with lychee and red curry sauce, inspired by the ship’s historic trade routes. 

Next, guests disembark and enter the Asiatique Ancient Tea House, a sensitively restored, 100-year-old wooden teahouse that offers premium teas and artisanal Chinese cuisine. In this charming setting, diners will sample an assortment of dim sum as an appetiser, capturing the flavours of the Middle Kingdom. 

The journey continues to The Crystal Grill House, a glasshouse steak and seafood restaurant where diners are welcomed into glittering surroundings. Guests can choose from international main courses, including centre-cut pork chop, Tasmanian king salmon, linguine pescatore, or a 300g Australian ribeye steak, each paired with a side dish of choice. 

The evening concludes at The Siam Tea Room, a traditional Thai restaurant and bakery. Here, guests indulge in Thai-inspired desserts, from sweet coconut sticky rice with ripe mango to pandan custard French toast and aloe vera compote with butterfly pea syrup, paired with a classic cocktail or mocktail. 

Available every evening from 1 October to 30 December 2024, from 16:00 to 22:00 hrs, Culinary Compass is priced at THB 2,888++ per person. Accessible by both road and river, Asiatique The Riverfront offers convenient shuttle boat services from Saphan Taksin BTS station, ensuring a seamless journey to and from this unique culinary adventure.

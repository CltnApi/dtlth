The vibrancy of swing dance is transformed into visual art during "Mood Swing", which will kick off on Saturday and run until Jan 18, at Asai Bangkok Chinatown on Charoen Krung Road.

Held in collaboration with 333Gallery, this is an interactive art exhibition that blends painting, swing dance and live jazz music, inviting travellers and locals to experience art in an engaging, hands-on way.

On showcase will be 10 original pieces of renowned artist Parangbune Meewasana, aka Mtt, who illustrates the powerful influence of swing dance on her artistic journey and how it shapes her creative process.

Inspired by the fluid steps and energetic rhythms of swing dance, each of her artworks captures the movement and emotion of the dance, transforming the vibrancy of swing into visual form.

On the opening night on Saturday, the spotlight will be on Woran Muangsiri, a passionate Lindy Hop dancer and musician, whose band The Stumbling Swingout aims to revive the joy of live swing music in Bangkok.

Scheduled for 5pm to 8pm at the hotel's courtyard, the fun evening will celebrate the coming together of art, swing dance and jazz music with captivating artwork inspired by the dynamic movements of swing dance accompanied by a swing dance performance, live jazz music and an open dance floor to all guests.

During the exhibition period, there will be special events on three evenings. They include a swing dance class with the Jelly Roll Jazz Club and an artist guided tour on Nov 30 at 5pm; and Social Night featuring an artist guided tour, dance performance, live jazz music and an open dance floor on Dec 21 and Jan 11 next year, both from 5pm to 8pm.

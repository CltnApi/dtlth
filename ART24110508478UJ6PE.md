**Manu Chao** released his last studio album La Radiolina in 2007. Prior to that, he released Clandestino in 1998 and Proxima Estacion: Esperanza in 2001 to global acclaim. He took off with a huge ensemble to tour the world after that, which resulted in the live album Radio Bemba Sound System in 2004. And prior to that, he had already played his version of punk rock, inspired by The Clash, with the legendary band Mano Negra.

Chao's eclectic music, spliced with found sounds and production touches that surprise, quickly became popular not only for this distinctive groove and potent lyrics but also for the positive and uplifting "feel" to his music.

After 17 years, he has finally released a new studio album, Viva Tu (Because Music), which came out in September. As usual, he has put together an ensemble of master musicians and guests, led by the lively country song Heaven's Bad Day which features US country music legend Willie Nelson, spare harmonica and handclaps. But this is not Chao's "American album" because his songwriting is such a hybrid process -- he finds things from outside the immediate music he's working on that add and surprise, and he always seems ready to experiment.

As a result, songs on the new album range from the tragic journeys of migrants across the Mediterranean Sea looking for a better life on the opening song Vecinos En El Mar to the uplifting rumba of the title track Viva Tu, with guitarist Salvadori providing the accompaniment. Chao's eclectic approach to songwriting and music assemblage is on show with the electro/rap of Sao Paulo Motoboy. And as with his other albums, there are some sad but uplifting ballads like Vecinos and Cuatro Calles, and perfect pop songs like the French/Spanish Tu Te Vas with French singer Laeti.

Viva Tu is a welcome return for Chao. In the perilous days we live, when tribalism and attacks on "otherness" seem to rule, Chao's commitment to cultural pluralism and musical collaboration stand out. Let's hope he takes the new album on the road -- and one day makes it to this part of the world. Producers and festival organisers, please take note. More information is available at manuchao.net. Highly recommended.

Another band that takes an eclectic approach to music making is Afro-Celt Sound System, which began with a debut album Volume 1: Sound Magic in 1996. The last studio album was Flight, released in 2018. The band's new album was delayed by a split between the members and the death of the founder Simon Emerson in 2023. Emerson did, however, complete work on the band's latest album, Ova (Six Degrees, USA). This fascinating album contains beautiful African songs like the West African-style N'Faly Foll and the dancefloor groove Badj Kan Waly. Although this album feels more Afro than Celt, there are some epic folk inspired songs like the opening track, The Hawk Owl's Lament and the turbo-charged and menacing final track, The Lockdown Reel. More information from afroceltsoundsystem.com.

Also worth checking out is the new album from France-based Afro-Latin "revivalists" The Bongo Hop. This genre-bending outfit their own version of "tropical pop", which was founded by trumpeter Etienne Sevet while he was working as a producer and DJ in Colombia with long-time collaborator and folkloric singer Nidia Gongora and Brazilian producer Lucas Santtana.

The band has a new album out, La Pata Coja on the Underdog label. The band has a distinctive soulful and jazzy sound honed from Caribbean and Latin influences, with lots of cool brass. The new album features eight tracks, each of which features a special guest. One of my favourite tracks so far showcases the remarkable singing of Haitian star Moonlight Benjamin. You can hear Gongora's fine voice on the final number, the radio version of the title track La Pata Coja. Recommended.

Finally, the Smithsonian Museum has opened an online portal for music and culture lovers called Storied Objects, which showcases objects that have featured during the institute's Folklife Festival. You can find the portal at festival.si.edu/storied-objects. You can also visit the Smithsonian's Music Pathways which provides in-depth stories, photos and music from different folk cultures around the world. Here you can browse the folk music of Turkey or follow an exploration of Spanish music and dance. While this part of the website is designed for students and teachers, I have found it a fascinating resource that I use to learn more about folk culture and music.

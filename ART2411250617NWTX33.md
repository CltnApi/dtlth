Get ready Bangkok as Grammy-nominated British singer-songwriter James Blunt is set to perform live for the first time in 13 years in Thailand. This highly anticipated concert will take place on Dec 1 at Idea Live, 5th floor, Bravo. The event marks a stop on Blunt's "The Who We Used To Be Tour" to celebrate his latest album and his illustrious two-decade career.

Blunt shot to global stardom with his debut album Back To Bedlam (2004), which sold over 18 million copies worldwide. The album's breakout hit, You're Beautiful, topped charts in 18 countries and made him the first British artist in nearly a decade to lead the US Billboard Hot 100. With its heartfelt lyrics and captivating melody, the song continues to resonate with fans worldwide. Blunt's other notable hits include Goodbye My Lover, 1973 and Stay The Night. His soulful music and emotional performances have earned him five Grammy nominations, two BRIT Awards and two MTV Video Music Awards.

The tour coincides with Blunt's latest album Who We Used To Be (2023), which reflects on themes of love, loss and nostalgia. The Bangkok concert promises a blend of chart-topping classics and fresh tracks, making it a can't-miss event for fans and new listeners alike. Known for his engaging live performances and charismatic banter, Blunt is expected to create an intimate and unforgettable experience. His last performance in Thailand in 2011 left a deep impression, and his long-awaited return is set to rekindle that connection.

"James Blunt: The Who We Used To Be Tour Live In Bangkok 2024" will be held at Idea Live, 5th floor, Bravo. Tickets range from 2,050 baht to 4,550 baht and are available at ticketmelon.com.

As Bangkok’s office market evolves, the city’s Central Business District (CBD) continues to attract businesses with over 400,000 sq. m. of prime office space introduced in 2024. Among the standout developments is PUNN Smart Workspace, a new 28-storey office building located on Rama IV Road, a rapidly emerging hub for commerce, tourism, and lifestyle. 

Developed by Dolsiri Development Co., Ltd., a collaboration between L.P.N. Development PCL. and Nye Estate Co., Ltd., PUNN offers more than 22,600 sq. m. of rental space designed under the Co-Growing Space concept. It connects seamlessly to major economic zones such as Silom, Sathorn, and Rama III, with excellent accessibility via MRT stations, major roads, and proximity to landmarks like Benchakiti Park and Med Park Hospital. 

PUNN Smart Workspace is built with sustainability at its core, earning LEED GOLD certification for its eco-conscious construction and design. Features include: 

*   An advanced air filtration system with CO2 and PM 2.5 sensors.
*   Intelligent lighting systems to reduce glare and optimise energy use.
*   Laminated IGU glass for consistent indoor temperatures and energy efficiency.
*   Smart security systems with real-time monitoring and assistance. 

According to Mr. Surawut Sukcharoensin, Chief Strategy Officer of L.P.N. Development PCL., PUNN aims to meet the needs of businesses by offering flexible, health-conscious, and efficient workspaces for professionals across generations. Starting at just THB 850 per square metre, PUNN is poised to become a landmark for the future of workspaces in Bangkok. 

As Rama IV emerges as the city’s new CBD hotspot, PUNN Smart Workspace stands out as a beacon of modernity, sustainability, and connectivity, designed to foster productivity, creativity, and environmental responsibility.

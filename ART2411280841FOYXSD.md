The department said it coordinated with the National Broadcasting and Telecommunication Commission and mobile phone operators to send out SMS alerts to residents of flood-prone areas on Wednesday, so they could prepare for the situation accordingly.

The public has also been urged to download the “Thai disaster alert” application to keep up with the latest news and warnings. People are urged to call the 1784 hotline to report an emergency or seek assistance.

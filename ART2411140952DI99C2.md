Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited has received the highest sustainability assessment in the Oil & Gas Refining and Marketing industry from the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) 2024.

As of 13 November 2024, Bangchak achieved the top CSA score out of over 70 companies in the Oil & Gas Refining and Marketing sector in the Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment. The company scored 85 out of 100, attaining the highest (Best Score) in two critical dimensions: Governance and Environment. This accomplishment reflects Bangchak’s commitment to sustainable business innovation, balancing environmental and social responsibility with strong corporate governance. 

Mr. Chaiwat Kovavisarach, Group Chief Executive Officer and President of Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited, stated, “Bangchak received the highest-level assessment from S&P Global CSA, a leading authority in sustainable investment responsible for evaluating companies for the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI). This achievement reaffirms our commitment to sustainable business practices that not only drive profitability but also promote value for society and the environment.” 

Bangchak has consistently participated in S&P Global’s assessment for the past decade, evaluating sustainable business operations and organisational development.

“Operating in accordance with ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) principles is more than a guideline for Bangchak’s sustainability; it is a way to create value for all stakeholders. Bangchak’s ability to operate effectively within ESG principles, earning global recognition with a top assessment, reaffirms our commitment to fostering a sustainable and responsible society,” Mr. Chaiwat concluded.

MDES Backs Thailand’s International Digital Business Centre

The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (MDES) is supporting the Thailand International Digital Business & Finance Centre (TIDC) project, a key collaboration to foster a digital-first ecosystem, attract investment in digital businesses, and drive the development of digital innovations within Thailand. The National Telecom Public Company Limited (NT) will also contribute to the TIDC project by participating as a leader in advancing digital business concepts.

The TIDC project aims to establish a globally unique, next-generation digital and online business hub in Thailand, enhancing current and future innovations while attracting investments from domestic and international digital enterprises, start-ups, and blue-chip companies. Key focus areas for the TIDC project include future-oriented gaming and immersive experiences, innovative FinTech solutions, digitalisation of public services, and expanding digital services across all sectors. This commitment to progress includes deploying advanced technologies such as AI, Machine Learning (ML), Blockchain, Big Data Analytics, Cloud Computing, and IDC Technology. 

Furthermore, the TIDC project aspires to create job opportunities and elevate the local workforce to international standards through knowledge transfer from global digital experts integrated within the project. This effort aligns with the National Digital Economy and Society Development Plan and Policy (2018-2037). The project will also introduce the “Digital Economy Regulatory Sandbox” (DERS), an experimental space for testing new digital business ideas. Within DERS, both the private and public sectors can collaboratively test, learn, and recommend regulatory approaches to ensure that consumers in Thailand benefit from innovations that meet global standards. 

Led by a team of seasoned international experts with proven success in deploying digital businesses worldwide, the TIDC project is set to attract high-value investments from world-class companies, positioning Thailand as a regional and global leader in digital business.

Pol Captain Wissanu Chimtrakul, the DSI deputy director-general, said the department decided to add more charges after further

Meanwhile, defence lawyer Withoon Kengngam said he had prepared information for the 18 executives to respond to the charges. He claimed the charges could be easily dismissed because they apply to operations that had no goods to sell, while iCon Group did have products to sell.

He also claimed that he has provided the DSI with a list of 700 witnesses, who are willing to testify in defence of the company’s operations.

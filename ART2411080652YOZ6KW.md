"BANDAI SPIRIT HOBBY EXHIBITIONS 2024" showcases Gunpla, short for "Gundam plastic model", featuring the PG UNLEASH RX-78 GUNDAM—the three-metre-tall Gundam model displayed for the first time in Southeast Asia. Visitors can also explore the largest selection of Gunpla model kits for 2024, including limited-edition models exclusively available at this event for the first time in Thailand, and participate in free model-building activities.

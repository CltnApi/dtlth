LIMA: US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on Saturday that human beings and not **artificial intelligence** should make decisions over the use of **nuclear weapons**, according to the White House.

"The two leaders affirmed the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons," the White House said in a statement.

"The two leaders also stressed the need to consider carefully the potential risks and develop AI technology in the military field in a prudent and responsible manner."

This would mark the first time the two countries have made such a declaration.

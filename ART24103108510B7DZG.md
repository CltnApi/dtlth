Huawei Cloud Stack provides innovative technology and cloud-enabled government services to propel Thailand towards becoming a regional cloud hub.

ASEAN is one of the world’s most dynamic regions, currently experiencing a digital economy boom. Situated at ASEAN’s centre, Thailand, as a leader in the regional digital economy, announced its "Cloud-First" policy in August, designating it as the core of its national digital transformation agenda. This policy encourages the government and industries alike to accelerate cloud adoption and seize strategic opportunities for digital economic growth, further promoting Thailand’s economic transformation and the realisation of a digital Thailand.  

Colonel Sanpachai Huvanandana, CEO of Thailand National Telecom (NT), said, "Thailand is adopting the Cloud-First policy to become ASEAN’s digital hub as soon as possible. We chose Huawei Cloud as our key partner to support this policy. We are providing cloud services to over 220 Thai government departments and expect to reduce investment budgets by 30% to 50%. With enhanced government services, we anticipate improved service quality for citizens and greater business promotion opportunities, making Thailand an attractive destination for global investment.” 

Wongkot Vijacksungsithi, Senior Executive Vice President of NT, added that NT is responsible for the implementation and operations of the Government Data Centre and Cloud Services (GDCC) project. Working alongside Huawei Cloud Stack, NT has established a multi-cloud environment for government services. This setup provides centralised management, swift time-to-market, high scalability, redundancy, and backup while meeting national security and compliance requirements. NT has also introduced innovative workloads such as a smart bus terminal, a one-stop service for the Eastern Economic Corridor, and a healthcare platform. 

Yuttasart Nitipaichit, Vice President of NT, said, “GDCC provides a unified cloud foundation and data-sharing platform for ministries and departments, with thousands of applications already deployed. Huawei Cloud Stack offers GDCC over 80 ready-to-use on-premises cloud services that seamlessly integrate with Huawei’s public cloud through a shared architecture. All cloud services are accessible with just one click, and Huawei Cloud Stack delivers comprehensive, full-stack capabilities that will help Thailand become a future Asian digital hub.” 

“To address the three major challenges in government transformation, Huawei Cloud Stack provides a three-cloud reference architecture: a security cloud, a government cloud, and a public cloud,” said Johnny Lv, CTO of Huawei Cloud Stack International Business. “Huawei Cloud Stack has powered over 800 government projects globally, and we are driven by our ambition to collaborate with global partners to support the worldwide shift to cloud technology, forging ahead with new milestones in digital transformation.”

The Pheu Thai Party experienced a shocking drop in popularity in the May 14, 2023, general election, losing to the Move Forward Party, which secured 151 seats compared to Pheu Thai's 141.

One factor behind the decline was the party's political communication strategy during the campaign.

Move Forward surged ahead in the final stretch, powered by a nationwide wave of momentum through both overt and covert "air wars".

These efforts leveraged social media platforms and synchronised campaign rallies, led by Pita Limjaroenrat, the party's leader. This sophisticated PR campaign has been retained by Move Forward’s successor, the People’s Party, which now leads the opposition to Pheu Thai’s government.

After Paetongtarn Shinawatra assumed leadership of Pheu Thai and rose to become Thailand's 31st prime minister with overwhelming coalition support, the party adopted a cautious communication strategy. This approach aimed to counter attacks from opposition forces, rival political camps, and former power blocs. Social media, in particular, emerged as a major battleground, undermining the party's long-term popularity.

**Jirayu Huangsap: govt spokesperson**

Jirayu, a former Bangkok MP for Pheu Thai, initially served as Paetongtarn's advisor before being appointed as government spokesperson. His role aimed to address weaknesses in the communication strategy of Srettha Thavisin's administration.

Jirayu's main focus has been on promoting the prime minister’s initiatives and achievements, rather than engaging in aggressive political rebuttals. This contrasts with his earlier role as an opposition MP, where he was known for his sharp and effective debating against adversaries.

**Nattawut: monitoring far-right movements**

The party continues to rely on Nattawut Saikua, who previously served as director of the Pheu Thai Family. However, Nattawut stepped down after Pheu Thai partnered with former political opponents to form the government coalition.

Nattawut was brought back into the Pheu Thai fold last month, appointed by Paetongtarn as her political advisor. Nattawut's behind-the-scenes role is believed to focus on shaping political communications for both the government and the Pheu Thai Party.

In his role as an advisor of the prime minister, Nattawut notably serves without a formal salary.  
Nattawut has used his skills as a political communicator to act as a staunch defender of Paetongtarn. Through his personal Facebook page, he addresses political issues, particularly those that could destabilise the government in the future.

A key focus has been countering nationalist and far-right narratives, which opponents have repeatedly used to challenge the prime minister. Among these is the controversy surrounding MOU 44 on the overlapping maritime claims between Thailand and Cambodia.

Nattawut also supported Pheu Thai's campaign for Sunday’s Udon Thani Provincial Administrative Organisation (PAO) election. This marked his first collaboration with former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, Pheu Thai’s patriarch, since rejoining the party fold.

His involvement in Pheu Thai’s campaign mirrored his contributions during the 2023 general election, helping to sustain momentum and ensure that the Udon Thani PAO remained under Pheu Thai's leadership.

**Jakrapob: Pheu Thai's heavy lifter**

Another key figure supporting Pheu Thai is Jakrapob Penkair, a former minister in the Prime Minister's Office.  
He recently played a crucial role in revitalising Pheu Thai's campaign in Samut Prakan province, speaking on "Current Thai Politics and Political Development Strategies” to energise support in the region.

Since his return to Thailand in March, Jakrapob has assisted the Pheu Thai government by participating in media interviews to counter various disinformation campaigns and attacks aimed at discrediting the Paetongtarn administration and the party itself.

Jakrapob has featured across multiple media outlets, offering academic insights and critiquing the policies of Pheu Thai’s rivals, particularly the People's Party. His efforts have focused on countering narratives around “colour conflicts” (red shirts vs orange shirts) and engaging in debates on policy differences between the two sides.

**Surapong Suebwonglee: Shaping PM Paetongtarn’s image**

Another key figure shaping Paetongtarn’s communication strategy is Surapong Suebwonglee, deputy chairman of the Prime Minister’s Policy Advisory Team. Surapong has been instrumental in crafting Paetongtarn’s communication approach, dating back to her tenure as chair of the party’s Advisory Committee on Participation and Innovation, and as leader of the Pheu Thai Family.

Surapong’s communication team, known as “Natasha”, is tasked with managing the PM’s public image. However, their latest effort met with criticism on social media, particularly regarding the Paetongtarn’s performance at last week’s Forbes Global CEO Conference in Bangkok. Critics said she failed to inspire confidence in Thailand among the international audience.

Surapong’s “air war” communication team has reportedly been working closely with Paetongtarn since her political debut. The team includes media professionals from Voice TV, some of whom are experienced hosts and presenters, adding depth to the PM’s media strategy.

Despite this, it has faced challenges in addressing social media criticism. Instead of direct responses, the team has relied on prominent Pheu Thai figures to counter criticism. Meanwhile, the government’s team of official spokespersons has chosen to remain silent on these matters.

Interestingly, the Pheu Thai’s evolving communication strategy seems to draw on a pool of seasoned government performers. The current spokesperson, Jirayu, is joined by three former spokespersons: Jakrapob, who served under the first Thaksin Shinawatra administration; Surapong, who held the role during Thaksin’s second term; and Nattawut, who briefly served under the Somchai Wongsawat administration.

**Thaksin: master communicator**

Another critical figure in this communication ecosystem is Thaksin Shinawatra himself. Acting as an informal spokesperson for his daughter, Thaksin has communicated government policies, political messages, and personal defences of PM Paetongtarn through local campaigns and both domestic and international media. This reflects his ongoing effort to bolster her political stature.

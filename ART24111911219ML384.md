True Corporation Plc., Thailand’s leading telecom-tech company, joined forces with the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (DE), Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DDPM), and Phuket Province to conduct a live simulation of the “LIVE – Cell Broadcast Service” (CBS) in Phuket on 19 November 2024. This initiative is designed to elevate safety standards in one of Thailand’s most prominent tourist destinations and bolster visitor confidence.

As the Cell Broadcast Center (CBC), True Corporation facilitated the system’s integration testing with the DDPM, which operates as the Cell Broadcast Entity (CBE), conducting a real-time, end-to-end network simulation. The CBS system is expected to officially launch soon, offering rapid, accurate, and inclusive alerts during emergencies.

**Phuket: A Strategic Choice for CBS Testing**

Phuket, a global tourist hotspot, is Thailand’s second-largest revenue generator after Bangkok. In 2023, the island welcomed 11.3 million tourists, including 8.4 million international visitors, contributing 388 billion baht to the local economy. Ranked “The Best Island Destination” by Bounce, Phuket was chosen as the ideal testing ground for CBS due to its significant role in Thailand’s tourism sector and its vulnerability to maritime natural disasters.

**Advancing Safety with Multi-Sector Collaboration**

Mr. Chakkrit Urairat, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer of True Corporation Plc., emphasised the importance of the test during the event:“True Corporation is proud to collaborate with NBTC, DE, and DDPM in conducting this CBS simulation test in Phuket, marking a significant step forward in developing a warning system to enhance safety for Thai citizens and visitors. This test underscores the power of collaboration and builds on our successful simulation in Bangkok last July.”

The system demonstrated its capacity to instantly deliver alerts to all mobile devices within risk areas without requiring prior registration. It supports multiple languages, including pop-up messages and audio alerts, as well as a Text-to-Speech feature for visually impaired users, ensuring inclusivity.

**Key Features of True’s Cell Broadcast System:**

1.  **Speed** – Immediate transmission of alerts during emergencies.
2.  **Accuracy** – Pinpoint targeting of affected areas.
3.  **Coverage** – Messages reach all users in risk zones without registration.
4.  **International Standards** – A globally recognised and widely used alert system.
5.  **Multi-language Support** – Alerts delivered in multiple languages simultaneously.

True has also established the Business and Network Intelligence Center (BNIC), a 24/7 emergency management hub, to oversee the system’s operation.

**Enhancing Safety Infrastructure for a Sustainable Future**

The “LIVE – Cell Broadcast Service” simulation in Phuket marks a major milestone in Thailand’s efforts to elevate safety infrastructure to international standards. By integrating cutting-edge technology with robust multi-sector collaboration, True Corporation and its partners aim to improve the quality of life for Thai citizens and enhance safety for international visitors.

As True continues system integration testing with the DDPM, the CBS promises to become a transformative tool in responding to emergencies, cementing Thailand’s reputation as a safe and welcoming destination for all.

An arrest warrant has been issued for a member of the forestry police after armed men attacked staff and stole 19 phayung logs and two guns from a forest conservation unit in Sakon Nakhon province on Saturday.

Surachai Achalaboon, director-general of the Royal Forestry Department (RFD), said on Tuesday the wanted man was Pol Sgt Theptawan Suriyamart of the Srithat forest unit in Udon Thani province.

The 6th forestry management office in Udon Thani had already dismissedÂ  Pol Sgt Theptawan from the service, Mr Surachai said.

He faces charges of colluding in theft, armed intrusion, physical assault or using violence or threatening to use violence, causing property damage, illegal detention and carrying firearms illegally in public, the RFD chief said.

At least five men were involved in the robbery at Warit-Panna forest protection unit in tambon Kud Takab in Waritchaphum district on the night of Nov 9.

Three forestry officials were assaulted and tied up. The thieves left with 19 phayung (Siamese rosewood) logs worth about 800,000 baht. They also stole two guns.

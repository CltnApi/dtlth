Myanmar workers protest at being duped

SAMUT SAKHON: About 100 Myanmar workers protested in front of a factory in Muang district after they paid a group of Thai brokers 3,000-7,000 baht each but did not receive the promised jobs.

Authorities came to meet them in front of Index Interfurn Company, an Index Living Mall warehouse on Ekachai Road in tambon Khok Kham.

According to Pol Col Somchai Khokha, superintendent of Khok Kham police station, the workers approached the security guard at the company's front door to inquire about job openings. The security guard called two young women to the gate who claimed to be job brokers, saying there were jobs for them.

They charged a fee of 3,000 to 7,000 baht per person. Some people paid in cash, while others transferred money to the given accounts and showed them a slip confirming the money transfer. The fake agents allegedly told all of the Myanmar workers to start work on Nov 20.

Some of the Myanmar workers told their friends about the jobs that were available. About 100 of them reportedly expressed interest in applying through the brokers.

The workers arrived at the company on Wednesday morning but were denied entry. One of the bogus agents informed them that their job would mean working the night shift. This upset some of the Myanmar workers, who asked for their money to be returned.

Police said the young woman claiming to be a broker agreed to return the money to them, but them promptly vanished without a trace, resulting in the crowd assembling in front of the company on Wednesday night.

A manager from Index Interfurn came out to meet with the protesters and informed them that the company was not recruiting any workers. Because production has ceased, the warehouse employs only 10 people. The facility is available for online sales companies to use as a distribution centre.

Regarding the two women claiming to be brokers, the company manager stated that he had never met them before and confirmed they were not employees of the firm.

Pol Col Somchai said police officers would track down the suspects, including the security guard. They will be charged with fraud, he added.

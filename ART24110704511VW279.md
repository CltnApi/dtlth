Over 1,500 runners participated in the 'Fly Green Charity Run 2024,' hosted by Vietjet Thailand at Vachirabenjatas Park, Bangkok, on 2 November 2024. The event aimed to raise funds for the Chaipattana Foundation’s environmental initiatives, reflecting both the airline’s and the foundation’s dedication to sustainable conservation and community support. 

This was the second charity run under Vietjet’s ‘Fly Green Fund,’ the airline’s flagship environmental programme committed to funding the Chaipattana Foundation’s eco-friendly projects. Mrs. Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul, former Minister of Tourism and Sports, and Mr. Sathirawat Ponnark, Vice President of Operations at Vietjet Thailand, officiated the opening ceremony and joined the run.

“We are proud to host our second charity run under Vietjet Thailand’s Fly Green Fund. As a transport provider, we prioritise environmental sustainability, continually working to reduce pollution and implementing eco-friendly measures to combat global warming. We deeply appreciate the public’s participation in this run, supporting us and the Chaipattana Foundation to build a greener, better future for the next generation,” said Mr. Sathirawat Ponnark. 

Net proceeds from the event will be donated to the Chaipattana Foundation to support environmental conservation and sustainable resource management, with the goal of planting 100,000 trees by the end of 2024. 

In alignment with Vietjet’s eco-friendly mission, race finishers received ‘Fly Green Charity Run’ medals crafted from recycled plastic bottle caps, shaped like leaves and coloured light green. This initiative helps repurpose waste and lower carbon footprints.

Since establishing the Fly Green Fund in 2021, Vietjet Thailand has launched various environmental projects, including the ‘Garbage Hunter’ clean-up initiative, the ‘Fly Green Charity Golf Day,’ the ‘Fly Green Metro Forest’ project to boost urban greenery, and the ‘Vietjet Fly Green Charity Concert,’ which raises awareness and funds through concert ticket sales.

Chiang Mai, once renowned for its cool weather and lush landscapes, is now battling an unseen enemy -- air pollution, specifically PM2.5. These microscopic particles, which infiltrate the air during the infamous burning season, have upended lives across Thailand.

For 20-year-old Chulalongkorn University student Chirawan Oranratmanee, the effects of PM2.5 are heartbreakingly personal. Her mother, a once-healthy professor, succumbed to lung cancer -- caused not by smoking, but by prolonged exposure to these toxic pollutants.

"Chiang Mai in our memories was a city with good air," Chirawan recalls wistfully. "When we were kids, we'd wake up to a cool breeze, even during summer. But by the time I was in high school, the heat had become unbearable, and PM2.5 pollution was a constant."

Masks and air purifiers became everyday necessities, but what felt like a temporary inconvenience soon took a terrifying turn.

At first, the impacts were minor -- nosebleeds among classmates, persistent allergy-like symptoms. But the true devastation came in early 2023, when Chirawan's mother, a professor at Chiang Mai University, began coughing up blood. What initially seemed like long Covid quickly spiralled into something far worse.

"We thought it was a lingering infection," Chirawan explains. "But after several tests, the doctors told us she had stage four lung cancer, caused by a gene mutation linked to PM2.5 exposure. We were devastated."

Her mother had always been healthy and active, a beacon of strength for the family. But the cancer progressed rapidly.

"She underwent targeted therapy, chemotherapy, radiation -- all of it," Chirawan says. "But each day, she grew weaker. Her hair fell out, she lost her voice. It was heartbreaking."

Sadly, on April 3, Chirawan's mother passed away.

"The hardest part is coming home and realising she used to be there," Chirawan says, her voice heavy with emotion. "Every time I walk through the door, it feels like she should still be sitting there, smiling, ready to greet me."

Chirawan's tragedy is part of a much larger crisis affecting Thailand. PM2.5 particles, which are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, are wreaking havoc on the nation's health.

According to the State of Global Air (SoGA) report, air pollution contributed to over 8 million deaths globally in 2021. Children are particularly vulnerable -- nearly 2,000 children under five die daily due to air pollution, with long-term effects on the lungs and immune system damaging many more.

In Thailand, air quality deteriorates during the burning season, particularly in northern cities like Chiang Mai. Despite the visible haze, many still underestimate the severity of the problem.

"People don't realise how dangerous PM2.5 is," says Chirawan. "When my mother was diagnosed, some even blamed her immune system, saying it was just bad luck. But it's not -- it's much closer to us than we think."

Grieving her mother's death, Chirawan found a sense of purpose through advocacy. She joined Unicef Thailand's #CountMeIn campaign, which amplifies the voices of young people affected by climate change and other manmade environmental harms.

"Sharing my story isn't just about coping with my loss," she says. "It's about raising awareness of the deadly consequences of air pollution."

Chirawan is particularly focused on ensuring that children and young people are part of the conversation.

"Children bear the greatest burden of climate change, but their voices are often overlooked," explains Waraporn Raksaphram, programme officer for Environment and Climate Action at Unicef Thailand. "We're calling on governments, businesses and decision-makers to protect children from the escalating climate crisis."

For Chirawan, the government and large corporations share the blame for failing to offer alternative solutions to practices like crop burning, which contributes to PM2.5 levels.

"I don't blame the farmers," she says. "They have no other choice -- burning crops is cheap and effective. But the government and corporations should step up with better solutions."

Despite the profound loss, Chirawan's journey is one of resilience and hope. She is determined to carry on her mother's legacy through her advocacy and her passion for voice acting. Chirawan has already voiced characters in popular games like Cookie Run: Kingdom and projects like Inside Out 2.

"My mum always supported my dreams," she says, her voice soft but steady. "Before she passed, I told her I got my first job as a voice actor. She was so proud."

Even in the midst of her grief, Chirawan finds strength in continuing to pursue her passion.

"It's not just about losing her; it's about losing the future moments we were supposed to share," she says. "But I carry her with me in everything I do."

As Thailand grapples with air pollution and the broader challenges of climate change, the stakes have never been higher for its younger generation. Children and young people like Chirawan are the most vulnerable to these environmental threats, yet their voices are often drowned out by bureaucratic and political noise.

Unicef Thailand is working to change that by promoting climate education and ensuring that young people are prepared for a climate-impacted future.

"We all need to ensure that children and youth are included in the conversations and solutions surrounding the climate crisis," Waraporn emphasises. "They are the ones most affected and will inherit this planet for many years to come."

For Chirawan, sharing her story is just the beginning. "The PM2.5 problem is bigger than just air pollution. It's about our health, our future and the kind of world we want to live in."

Her mother's passing has fuelled her determination to be a voice for change.

"I want people to realise how urgent this issue is," she adds. "By sharing my story, I hope more people understand the devastating impact of air pollution and that we need to act -- now."

Chirawan's story is a stark reminder of the human cost of environmental negligence. As the world faces escalating climate crises, it's crucial that the voices of children like Chirawan are heard and amplified. The future of Thailand's children -- and indeed, the world -- depends on the steps we take today.

In the fight for cleaner air and a sustainable future, Chirawan's voice must not be ignored.

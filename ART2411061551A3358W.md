PALM BEACH - Donald Trump has been elected US president, capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House and ushering in a new American leadership likely to test democratic institutions at home and relations abroad.

Trump, 78, recaptured the White House on Wednesday after a campaign marked by dark rhetoric that deepened the polarisation in the country, prevailing after two attempts on his life and a late decision by Democrats to run Kamala Harris when President Joe Biden withdrew from the race in July.

The former president’s victory in the swing state of Wisconsin pushed him over the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency. As of 8am Wednesday Washington time (8pm Thailand time), Trump had won 279 electoral votes to Harris’ 223 with several states yet to be counted, Edison Research projected.

He also led Harris by more than 5 million votes in the popular count, putting him on course to become the first Republican to win the popular vote since 2004.

“America has given us an [unprecedented and powerful mandate](https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2897271/trump-claims-powerful-mandate-after-fox-news-projects-victory),” Trump said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in Florida.

Trump prevailed despite persistently low approval ratings. Impeached twice, he has been [criminally indicted](https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2897418/trump-win-brings-his-criminal-cases-to-a-halt) four times and found civilly liable for sexual abuse and defamation. In May, Trump was convicted by a New York jury of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to a porn star.

Trump’s political career had appeared to be over after his false claims of election fraud led a mob of supporters to storm the US Capitol on Jan 6, 2021, in a failed bid to overturn his 2020 defeat.

But he swept away challengers inside his Republican Party and then beat Democratic candidate Harris by capitalising on voter concerns about high prices and what Trump claimed, without evidence, was a rise in crime due to illegal immigration.

Harris did not speak to supporters who had gathered at her alma mater Howard University. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, told the crowd after midnight that Harris would speak publicly later on Wednesday.

A source close to the campaign said Harris would make her public remarks at around 6pm Eastern time (6am Thursday Thailand time).

Republicans won a US Senate majority, but neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.

Major stock markets around the world rallied following Trump’s victory, and the dollar was set for its biggest one-day jump since 2020.

#### Jobs and the economy

Voters identified jobs and the economy as the country’s most pressing problem, according to Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls. Many Americans remained frustrated by higher prices even amid record-high stock markets, fast-growing wages and low unemployment.

With the Biden administration taking much of the blame, a majority of voters said they trusted Trump more than Harris to address the issue.

Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and lower-income households hit hardest by inflation helped fuel Trump’s election victory. His loyal base of rural, white and non-college educated voters again showed up in force.

World leaders from Europe to Asia congratulated Trump, whose victory will have major implications for US trade and climate change policies, the war in Ukraine, Americans’ taxes and immigration.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed what he called Trump’s commitment to “peace through strength”, while the Kremlin said it would wait and see if his victory could help end the war in Ukraine more quickly. Trump said while campaigning that he could end the in 24 hours.

Trump’s victory came as a relief for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has clashed with the Biden administration over the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon and on Wednesday called Trump’s win “history’s greatest comeback”.

Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, said the election was a matter for the American people, but it called for an end to the “blind support” for Israel from the United States.

Trump was expected to field calls from a variety of foreign leaders who had requested to talk to him, an adviser said.

Trump’s tariff proposals could spark a fiercer trade war with China and US allies, while his pledges to reduce corporate taxes and implement a spate of new cuts could balloon US debt, economists say.

Trump has promised to launch a mass deportation campaign targeting immigrants in the country illegally.

He has said he wants the authority to fire civil servants he views as disloyal. His opponents fear he will turn the Justice Department and other federal law enforcement agencies into political weapons to investigate perceived enemies.

A second Trump presidency could drive a bigger wedge between Democrats and Republicans on issues such as race, gender, what and how children are taught, and reproductive rights. (Story continues below)

#### Harris falls short

Vice President Harris fell short in her 15-week sprint as a candidate, failing to galvanise enough support to defeat Trump, who occupied the White House from 2017-21, or to allay voters’ concerns about the economy and immigration.

Harris had warned that Trump wanted unchecked presidential power and posed a danger to democracy.

Nearly three-quarters of voters say American democracy is under threat, according to Edison Research exit polls, underscoring the polarisation in a nation where divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race.

Trump ran a campaign characterised by apocalyptic language. He called the United States a “garbage can” for immigrants, pledged to save the economy from “obliteration” and cast some rivals as the “enemy within.”

His diatribes were often aimed at migrants, who he said were “poisoning the blood of the country,” or Harris, whom he frequently derided as unintelligent.

Despite legal woes and controversies, Trump is only the second former president to win a second term after leaving the White House. The first was Grover Cleveland, who served two four-year terms in the late 1800s.

#### Unprecedented campaign

Two months after Trump’s conviction in the hush money case, a would-be assassin’s bullet grazed his right ear during a July campaign rally in Pennsylvania, exacerbating fears about political violence.

Another assassination attempt was thwarted in September at his Florida golf course. Trump blamed both attempts on what he claimed was the heated rhetoric of Democrats including Harris.

Barely eight days after the July shooting, Biden, 81, dropped out of the race, finally bowing to weeks of pressure from his fellow Democrats after a poor performance during his debate with Trump called into question his mental acuity and the viability of his reelection bid.

Biden’s decision to step aside turned the contest into a sprint, as Harris raced to mount her own campaign in a matter of weeks, rather than the typical months. Her rise to the top of the ticket reenergised despondent Democrats, and she raised more than $1 billion in less than three months while erasing what had been a solid Trump lead in opinion polls.

Harris’ financial advantage was partly countered by the intervention of the world’s richest man, [Elon Musk](https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2897422/what-will-elon-musk-get-for-his-130-million-), who poured more than $100 million into a super PAC mobilising Trump voters and used his social media site X to amplify pro-Trump messaging.

As the campaign drew to a close, Harris increasingly focused on warning Americans about the perils of reelecting Trump and offered an olive branch to disaffected Republicans.

She highlighted remarks from several former Trump officials, including his former chief of staff and retired Marine Corps General John Kelly, who described Trump as a “fascist.”

Trump’s victory will broaden the fissures in American society, given his false claims of election fraud, anti-immigrant rhetoric and demonisation of his political opponents, said Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University who studies voter behavior and party politics.

#### A Trump second term

Trump has vowed to reshape the executive branch, including firing civil servants he views as disloyal and using federal law enforcement agencies to investigate his political enemies, violating a longstanding policy of keeping such agencies independent.

During his first term, Trump’s most extreme demands were sometimes stymied by his own cabinet members, most notably when Vice President Mike Pence refused to block Congress from accepting the 2020 election results.

Trump and his incoming vice president, US Senator JD Vance, are due to take office on Inauguration Day, Jan 20. Trump has signalled he will prioritise personal fealty in staffing his administration. He promised roles in his administration to Musk and former presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr, both avid supporters.

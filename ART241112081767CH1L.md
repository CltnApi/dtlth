One of HALE (Health Adjusted Life Expectancy) indicators is the oldest age estimation in which one—despite in senior years—is healthy with no health conditions. A report by Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health in 2023 stated that the aforesaid estimation is at 68 for Thai men in general and 72 for Thai women. In comparison with latest average life expectancy of Thais, this means Thais in general will live their lives with deteriorating heath for 5-7 years while the global average is closer to 10 years. Evidently, this study is an alarming sign so all people wherever they are can ensure they can live healthy with a good state of wellness even in senior years so they can enjoy doing what they want—especially during the last 10 years of their lives—so they do not become burden of others and society at large.

**Somboon Roongphornchai, M.D., a professor at School of Anti-Aging and Regenerative Medicine, Mae Fah Luang University**, elaborated on common behaviors that can increase health risks in senior years of one’s life: “On factors affecting one’s heath particularly during the last 10 years of one’s life and causation of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), many medical research papers have shown that the root cause is risky behaviors while one is carrying on with his or her in daily life.  For instance, ‘imbalanced food consumption’ with food that are too salty or too sweet can lead to excessively high sugar and fat in blood. Other causes include ‘lack of physical exercise for a long time’ which can cause high body fat and digestion system deterioration, ‘consumption of alcoholic drinks on a regular basis’ which can cause liver inflammation, ‘heavy smoking’ which can cause emphysema, ‘stress and lack of sleep’ which can cause malfunction in one’s bodily functions and increase chances of getting sick, as well as ‘constant exposure to harmful light and pollutants’ such as UV, exhaust smoke or insecticides. An overlooked habit that many people think it has no consequences like ‘not eating breakfast’ can affect one’s health in both short term and long term since breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Skipping breakfast means the body will be deprived of essential nutrients and it can consequently affect physical functions.”

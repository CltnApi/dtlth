The Mall Lifestore, in partnership with Bangkok Bank, UOB Thailand, AEON Thana Sinsap (Thailand), TMBThanachart Bank, Muang Thai Life Assurance, and Toyota Motor Thailand, proudly presents the “THE MALL LIFESTORE JOY OF GIVING” event. Embracing the concept “World of Imagination by JWON,” this enchanting celebration features a stunning Christmas tree and the delightful ‘Dylie’ character, brought to life by acclaimed Thai designer JWON. Running until 12 January 2025, this event embodies the festive spirit, offering joy-filled experiences at every branch of The Mall Lifestore and The Mall Korat. 

The centrepiece of the season, the ‘Dylie’ Christmas tree, invites visitors into JWON TOWN, a whimsical world of colour and creativity. Designed by Sarawut Kura-kaew, this charming addition to the festive decor is sure to captivate all ages while inspiring young minds with its artistic flair. 

The holiday season was officially launched with a grand tree-lighting ceremony at The Mall Lifestore Bangkapi, graced by Mr. Varawut Silpa-archa, Minister of Social Development and Human Security, alongside The Mall Group’s Chief Marketing Officer, Miss Voralak Tulaphorn. Highlights included a live concert by Film-Tanapath Kavilat and ONE TRAINEE, as well as the dazzling debut of Opal-Suchata Chongsiri, Miss Universe Thailand 2024’s 3rd runner-up. 

Throughout the season, families can immerse themselves in a host of festive activities and special promotions, transforming The Mall Lifestore into a true ‘landmark of happiness.’ 

The joy of giving takes centre stage with the “M SMILING BOX” campaign, created in collaboration with the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, Workpoint Entertainment, and corporate partners. This initiative invites visitors to donate gifts to children and youth in care centres across 31 locations, with 3,800 children set to benefit. Donations can be made via bank transfer or at designated boxes in The Mall Lifestore branches and participating stores between 22 November 2024 and 5 January 2025. 

On 25 December 2024, join us for a magical Christmas Carol event at all branches of The Mall Lifestore and The Mall Korat. Delight in interactive activities such as AR Navigation and AR Frame Dylie by JWON via the MCard app, a Dylie-themed painting workshop, Gashapon games, and spectacular performances by top artists, including Palmmy, Gulf-Khanawat, Christina Aguilar, and The Parkinson. 

Adding to the excitement, the “JOY LUCKY” promotion offers shoppers the chance to win fabulous prizes, including a Toyota Camry, round-trip tickets to Tokyo or Osaka, exclusive Dylie merchandise, and more. 

Celebrate the magic of the season with The Mall Lifestore, where joy, love, and giving come together in spectacular style. The festivities run until 12 January 2025, so don’t miss this opportunity to create unforgettable holiday memories.

At 6.30am, Samut Sakhon police reported severe congestion on both inbound and outbound lanes of Rama II Road near the construction site, with cars tailing back as far as km.23 and km.16, respectively.

Motorists are advised to use Phetkasem and Phutthasakhon roads to avoid the affected route, police said.

Rama II Road is notorious for “never-ending” construction work that has been blamed for multiple accidents.

In May this year, a concrete beam fell onto the road at a construction site in front of Index Living Mall in Bangkok’s Bang Khun Thian district, killing one worker and injuring another, and also damaging four passing vehicles.

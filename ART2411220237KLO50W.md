The wait is almost over as the much-anticipated Netflix series Squid Game Season 2 is ramping up excitement with the release of art and a set of 12 stills from the show.

Three years after winning _Squid Game_, Player 456 gave up going to the US and comes back with a new resolution in mind. Gi-hun once again dives into the mysterious survival game, starting another life-or-death game with new participants gathered to win a prize of 45.6 billion won (1.1 billion baht).

Director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who made history at the 74th Primetime Emmys by becoming the first Asian to win Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series, once again helms the series as director, writer, and producer.

Lee Jung-jae, Lee Byung-hun, Wi Ha-jun and Gong Yoo reprise their roles from Season 1 with an impeccable list of new cast members including Yim Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Park Gyu-young, Lee Jin-uk, Park Sung-hoon, Yang Dong-geun, Kang Ae-sim, Lee David, Choi Seung-hyun, Roh Jae-won, Jo Yu-ri and Won Ji-an rounding out the ensemble of colourful characters in the new season.

_Squid Game_ Season 2 is set to premiere in over 190 countries globally on Dec 26 on Netflix.

Authorities have arrested a man holding a Singaporean passport following a **bomb threat** called in against an AirAsia flight departing from Bangkok to Hat Yai.

The threat was reported at 2.47pm on Thursday. An individual, reportedly speaking Thai with an accent, contacted Don Mueang airport public relations and claimed that an AirAsia flight to Hat Yai in Songkhla was carrying explosives.

According to staff, the threat referred to flight FD 3114, which was taxiing for take-off at the time. Security personnel halted the flight for inspection, and it was eventually cancelled for a more thorough check, requiring all 162 passengers and six crew members to disembark.

The emergency status declared for the aircraft was only lifted at 7.30pm that day after security gave clearance.

The Immigration Bureau reported on Saturday that after tracing the call, authorities detained a man identified as Ho Wai Chong on Friday evening in the passenger terminal of Don Mueang. He apparently made the call while at the terminal.

According to his passport, he is a Singaporean national, and checks of immigration data showed that he had overstayed his visa.

The suspect admitted to the offence, saying he felt compelled to make the call due to family-related stress. He has initially been charged with overstaying his visa by 28 days and is being processed for further legal action.

The offender reportedly entered Thailand using an Apec Card on several occasions and has no record of wrongdoing. Because of the serious aviation law violation, he faces up to 15 years in prison and will be blacklisted from the country upon completion of his sentence.

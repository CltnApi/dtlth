**Why watch it?**

The filming of the Helm's Deep sequences was so gruelling and went on for so many months, that Jackson gave all the extras a free T-shirt to commemorate the experience. There were so many extras that they would often recognise each other in New Zealand's main cities, by wearing the shirts. On the front of the shirt was the statement "I Survived Helm's Deep", with the letter M is struck out, indicating "hell" of the experience. Two versions existed. One was in black, with red printing on the back that read "Lord Of The Rings Uruk-Hai Battalion”. The other was in blue with silver printing on the back that read "The Lord Of The Rings Elf Regiment”.

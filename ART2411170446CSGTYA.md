**Navigating the International Film Festival Landscape**

**Ming-Jung Kuo** emphasised the importance of understanding the nuances of film-festival submissions. She stressed that different festivals have distinct criteria and submission processes.

_**"If you want to submit films to Cannes, there are different organisations, so different offices,"**_ she explained. _**"Don’t just submit one and think everyone watched the films."**_

**The Unique Appeal of Thai Cinema**

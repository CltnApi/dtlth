Pruxus Design, a Bangkok-based UX consulting agency, is bringing back its popular "Usability and Heuristic Evaluation Workshop 2024" on Nov 16 at S64 Co-working Space. This annual workshop is made for designers, product managers and anyone interested in creating user-friendly experiences, with a focus on understanding and applying usability principles in real-world scenarios.

Pruxus Design emphasises a crucial design question: What makes a product genuinely useful? While aesthetics and storytelling play essential roles, the agency believes usability is the true cornerstone of effective design. Their approach aims to help designers move beyond superficial appeal to ensure products are intuitive, functional and truly serve users' needs. Everyday frustrations such as confusing app interfaces, registration forms that reject users and store layouts that leave customers lost are symptoms of poor usability that Pruxus aims to address through this workshop.

Centred on heuristic evaluation, a practical usability assessment technique, the workshop gives participants hands-on experience in assessing products for usability, identifying potential pain points and prioritising improvements. The morning session will guide participants through the principles of usability engineering, covering essential psychological factors like cognition and perception that shape user experiences. With expert-led insights, participants will learn to evaluate designs more effectively, examining where and why usability breaks down.

The afternoon session will be an interactive lab where participants apply these principles to real-world usability issues across digital systems. Under the guidance of Pruxus Design's founder, Phicharn Rattanathikun, and a team of teaching assistants from top organisations, participants will practise analysing interfaces, documenting usability findings and prioritising fixes. This hands-on experience aims to empower attendees with the practical skills needed to integrate usability feedback into their own design processes, transforming usability issues into actionable improvements.

Phicharn, known for his user-centred design approach and deep UX experience across both Thailand and Silicon Valley, will lead the workshop. His team's combined expertise provides participants with insights into best practices and personalised feedback that goes beyond surface-level design to address genuine user needs.

The workshop is ideal for anyone seeking a structured, systematic approach to usability, moving beyond intuition to data-driven and user-centred design decisions. Prior UX experience is not required, making it accessible to a broad range of professionals eager to learn the fundamentals of usability analysis.

Pruxus Design's "Usability and Heuristic Evaluation Workshop 2024" will be held on Nov 16, 2024 at S64 Co-working Space (Silom 64 Building) from 10am onwards. Tickets range from 6,900 baht to 8,900 baht, available at ticketmelon.com.

Israeli food technology can help boost Thailand's agriculture sector and the two countries can together help strengthen global food security, said the Israeli Ambassador Orna Sagiv.

During the "Savor the Future of Food: Satisfy Your Hunger with Israel's Innovation" event in Bangkok last week, Ms Sagiv emphasised Thailand's reputation as the "kitchen of the world", saying the country has been playing a major role in producing and supplying food for the global population.

She said Thailand has a strong agricultural sector, which will be crucial in resolving the world's food crisis.

Israel's innovative agricultural solutions and food technology would support Thailand in strengthening its own agriculture and food sectors, she said.

She sees a bilateral collaboration between Thailand and Israel on food technology as a win-win situation.

Ms Sagiv said Israel regards Thailand as a gateway into Southeast Asia and the greater Asian region.

This year has seen growing mutual interest between big Thai companies and Israeli startups, especially in food tech ventures, seeking solutions for tomorrow, she said.

While Israeli startups are equipped with advanced innovation they have little power to access larger markets, and would welcome assistance in improving their market management capacity.

On the other hand, the Thai conglomerate food companies have the experience, access and ability to localise Israeli products in a Southeast Asian context.

"The cooperation will create a solution, not only for two countries but for the world in terms of food security," she said.

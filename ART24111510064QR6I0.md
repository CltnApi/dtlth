UNICEF Thailand has unveiled the “Box of Life” campaign, rallying everyone to take action and donate essential aid to children in crisis. Part of the broader **“A Better Tomorrow Today”** initiative, the campaign aims to build a brighter future for underprivileged children in Thailand and worldwide, focusing on critical needs such as health, nutrition, disaster relief, and social equity.

The **“Box of Life”**, UNICEF's life-saving kit, is designed to provide basic necessities for children in emergency situations. It includes items like vaccines, therapeutic food, water purification tablets, hygiene kits, and educational supplies. These kits not only safeguard children but also lay a strong foundation for their growth and development, even amid adversity. Supporting the **Box of Life** is a step toward securing a stable future for every child, offering them safety, health, and hope.

The campaign is supported by prominent figures, including **Madame Pang Nualphan Lamsam**, UNICEF Thailand Goodwill Ambassador; actors **James Jirayu Tangsrisuk** and **Chakrit Yamnam**; and badminton athlete **Porpor Supisara Paewsampran**. These advocates emphasise the importance of helping children achieve brighter futures through collective support.

UNICEF Thailand Representative Ms. Kyungsun Kim stated, _“Children worldwide face increasing crises that threaten their health, safety, and future. The time to unite is now—not just to address these emergencies but to ensure no child fights alone. The ‘Box of Life’ is more than a kit; it’s a bridge to brighter futures and a symbol of hope and opportunity.”_

To raise awareness, UNICEF has launched a **“Box of Life”** video on BTS Skytrain networks across Bangkok and introduced a special **“Train to the Future”** activity. This initiative transforms train cars into mobile galleries showcasing vibrant artwork by children, symbolising a journey toward a safer, brighter world.

**The Global Crisis for Children**

Millions of children worldwide face preventable hardships. Daily, 13,400 children lose their lives due to lack of essentials like vaccines, clean water, and proper hygiene. Additionally, 45 million children suffer from acute malnutrition, resulting in one million deaths annually. Diseases like malaria claim 400,000 young lives each year, while 250 million children lack access to education, especially in conflict zones.

In East Asia and the Pacific, 65% of children face climate-related threats such as floods and pollution—nearly double the global average.

Madame Pang emphasised, _“Behind every statistic is a child full of potential, dreams, and the right to a brighter future. These crises are solvable if we act together. Supporting the ‘Box of Life’ means not just delivering aid but also providing hope and opportunities for children to grow safely and strongly.”_

Athlete Porpor Supisara added, _“The future of children depends on the opportunities they receive, including inspiration and hope. Seeing them thrive is the greatest value for society.”_

Actor Chakrit Yamnam noted, _“Every child deserves support in education and life skills in a nurturing environment. Our collective support can give them a chance for a better life.”_

Actor James Jirayu highlighted, _“Helping children, whether through donations, activities, or sharing information, creates opportunities for them to become a driving force for positive change in the future.”_

**A Call to Action**

As a global humanitarian organisation, UNICEF is committed to reaching the most vulnerable children, even in the hardest-to-reach areas. By 2030, UNICEF aims to provide safe hygiene to one billion people globally, with **“Box of Life”** as a key instrument in achieving this goal.

In 2023, UNICEF delivered 2.8 billion vaccine doses to 105 countries, reaching nearly half of the world’s children under five. It also supplied 80% of the world’s emergency therapeutic food and distributed 42 million learning materials to over 28.3 million children.

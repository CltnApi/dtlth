For smaller gatherings, the **Takeaway Glazed Ham Set** offers a delightful option, complete with cornbread stuffing, roasted potatoes, vegetable casserole, cranberry and giblet sauces, and sautéed French beans with bacon. Ideal for 2-3 people, this set is available at **THB 1,600++**.

No Thanksgiving feast is complete without dessert, and the **Takeaway Pecan Pie** provides a sweet ending. This classic treat, serving up to six, is available for **THB 900++**.

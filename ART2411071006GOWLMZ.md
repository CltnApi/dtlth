KHON KAEN - A maid has been sentenced to 235 years in jail for dozens of thefts of gold ornaments worth about 25 million baht from her employer’s shop.

The owner of the gold shop in Ban Pai district of the northeastern province told police that he first became suspicious two months ago when he saw a gold necklace falling from the woman’s apron pocket, a court heard.

When asked, the suspect, identified as Somjit Khumduang, said the necklace might have slipped into her pocket while she was standing at the display counter.

The owner later reviewed his security camera videos and discovered 47 instances of the woman stealing gold jewellery going back to 2021. The items stolen were worth about 25 million baht, he said.

Police said the accused used the stolen items to buy land and other valuables. She also posted photos on her Facebook, showing off a new motorcycle and new jewellery.

The owner said he told the woman many times to return what she had stolen but only about 7 million baht was given back.

Ms Somjit had been a maid at the shop for about 10 years, the owner said.

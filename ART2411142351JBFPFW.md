Honda is set to bring global golf excitement to Thailand once again as the prestigious Honda LPGA Thailand 2025 will take place between Feb 20-23 at the iconic Siam Country Club, Old Course, in Pattaya next year.

The 18th edition of the tournament aims to elevate the sport's global profile and reach a wider audience and golf fans can anticipate thrilling performances from 72 of the world's top players, competing for a prize pool of US$1.7 million (approximately 60 million baht).

Earlier this year, fans witnessed an exhilarating victory by Thai star Patty Tavatanakit, who claimed the title with a total score of 21 under, narrowly defeating Albane Valenzuela of Switzerland, who finished second on 20 under.

Patty, who will return in 2025 to defend her title, commented, "My journey with the Honda LPGA Thailand began in 2015 as an amateur. This tournament has held a special place in my heart since I was young and winning the title in front of my parents and Thai fans is a memory I'll always treasure. Defending my title will be another exciting challenge, and I'm constantly preparing. I'd love to invite everyone to join the fun and support all the players and me."

In the 2024 LPGA Tour season, several Thai golfers have excelled, securing numerous international titles. Notable achievements include Jeeno Thitikul's victory at the Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational, Chanettee Wannasaen's win at the Dana Open, Moriya Jutanugarn's triumph at the Portland Classic, and Jasmine Suwannapura's recent success at the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship.

With Thai golfers making their mark on the global stage, the 2025 Honda LPGA Thailand will be closely watched to see if a Thai player can claim the title for the third time, following victories by Ariya Jutanugarn in 2021 and Patty this year.

In addition to the competition between 72 world-class golfers, the event features various activities, including the National Qualifiers -- a valuable opportunity for Thai golfers to gain international experience, the Junior Golf Programme that selects and trains young golfers under 16, helping them refine their skills, with 25 finalists participating in a Junior Golf Clinic that allows them to interact with world-class golfers during tournament week. The event also includes a Young Ambassador Programme, a Volunteer Programme, and CSR initiatives, including a donation to the Siriraj Foundation to support patient care.

Tickets for both general admission and VIP access are available for purchase at www.hondalpgathailand.com.

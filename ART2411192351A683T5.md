Art collectors and enthusiasts are invited to admire outstanding artwork by top artists during "Driven", which is running at River City Bangkok's RCB Artery and RCB Galleria 4, Charoen Krung 24, from tomorrow to Sunday.

Presented by the Art Auction Center, this art auction and exhibition will feature 133 pieces of art by the likes of Pratuang Emjaroen, Thawan Duchanee, Damrong Wong-uparaj, Chatchai Puipia, Chakrabhand Posayakrit, Prayoon Uluchadcha, Muebon, Thongmai Thepram and Gongkan.

All lots will be available for viewing daily from 11am to 7pm before they will go under the hammer on Sunday at 2pm.

For extra delight, however, special models of super luxury cars from 911 Assistant, Thailand's leading premier Porsche service centre, will be displayed alongside the impressive artworks.

This might sound like a contrast, but, what seems different here can, in fact, blend nicely, with each having its own unique appeal. Top automobiles and works of art are similar in that they are made with determination, meticulousness and the inspiration of their creators.

The show is an opportunity to indulge in various experiences in terms of arts and technology. Visitors will discover that beauty that goes beyond the realm of art and feel the "drive" behind the automobile and artistic worlds.

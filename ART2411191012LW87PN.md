The State Railway of Thailand (SRT) has proposed a novel idea to boost revenue and enhance the travel experience: selling alcohol on trains. The SRTâ€™s proposal is currently being reviewed by the Alcohol Beverage Control Committee.



The SRT argues that selling alcohol on trains aligns with the government's tourism promotion efforts and could help alleviate the state enterprise's financial woes. Offering alcoholic beverages on board would attract more passengers and generate additional revenue, it said.



However, the proposal has raised concerns among public health advocates and safety experts. Critics argue that allowing alcohol consumption on trains could lead to increased drunkenness, disorderly behaviour, and accidents.

**Public Health Minister Somsak Thepsuthin** said, _**"While the SRT's desire to boost revenue is understandable, we must prioritise public safety. We need to carefully consider the potential consequences of allowing alcohol consumption on trains, especially regarding passenger safety and security."**_



The Alcohol Beverage Control Committee said it is carefully considering the potential risks and benefits before making a decision on the proposal.



In related news, the committee has approved new guidelines for hotel alcohol sales. Hotels will now be allowed to sell alcohol 24 hours a day, but only for consumption in guest rooms.

The panel also approved guidelines for local alcohol control and New Year's festivities. These guidelines aim to reduce alcohol-related harm and promote responsible drinking.



The committee said it had almost finished reviewing the draft Alcohol Beverage Control Act, an amalgamation of five different drafts submitted by the government, political parties and a civic group. The new draft should be ready for deliberation in Parliament by mid-December, it reported. The new bill is expected to give local authorities more power to ease alcohol controls in their jurisdictions.



_**"We must strike a balance between promoting economic growth and ensuring the well-being of our citizens," Somsak commented.**_

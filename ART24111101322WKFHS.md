According to a newly issued decree, the **Vietnamese** government is extending the pilot programme to allow Vietnamese to gamble in casinos.

Regarding the pilot program permitting Vietnamese citizens to gamble at casinos, the decree stated that the pilot period is three years from when the first casino business allows Vietnamese citizens to play.

After three years, the Government will review, evaluate, and decide whether to continue permitting Vietnamese citizens to gamble at casinos or terminate the license.

In 2016, the **Politburo** approved a three-year pilot programme permitting Vietnamese citizens to gamble at casinos in **Phu Quoc** Island (in the southern province of **Kien Giang**) and **Van Don** (in the northern province of **Quang Ninh**). However, only Phu Quoc’s casino began operations in January 2019, with the pilot programme scheduled to conclude in January 2022.

In 2022, the Ministry of Finance proposed extending the pilot for two additional years in Phu Quoc, citing the **Covid-19** pandemic’s impact on casino operations and limited trial results.

In May, the Politburo approved extending the pilot programme at Phu Quoc until the end of this year. For the **Van Don** project, the three-year pilot will begin once the casino becomes operational (it is not yet open).

To swiftly codify this pilot extension, the Government issued Decree No. 145/2024/ND-CP on November 4, 2024, amending Clause 2, Article 12 of Decree No. 03/2017/ND-CP to outline pilot programme durations as follows: For the first licensed casino business, the pilot programme is extended until December 31, 2024, for other casinos licensed to conduct the pilot (if any), the trial period is three years from the date of business certification.

The decree specifies that upon the end of these trial periods, businesses must cease allowing Vietnamese citizens to gamble until the Government issues a decree either ending or continuing permission for Vietnamese citizens to play.

The Ministry of Finance, in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the Ministry of Culture, **Sports and Tourism**, the **State Bank of Viet Nam** and the provincial People's Committees overseeing the pilot casinos, will conduct assessments and report to the Government on the feasibility of continuing or ending Vietnamese citizen access. These reports are due by November 30, 2024, for the first casino to receive a pilot licence and sixty days before the end of any subsequent trial periods for other casinos.

Based on the competent authorities’ findings, the Government will issue a resolution on whether to end or continue permitting Vietnamese citizens to gamble at casinos.

Currently, nine casinos operate in Viet Nam, including six small-scale casinos in **Do Son** (**Hai Phong**), **Loi Lai**, **Hoang Gia** and **Hong Van Hotel** (**Quang Ninh**), International Hotel (**Lao Cai**), Silver Shores (**Da Nang**). There are three large-scale casinos in **Nam Hoi An** (**Quang Nam**), **Ho Tram** (**Ba Ria** - **Vung Tau**) and **Phu Quoc** (**Kien Giang**).

Among these, Phu Quoc’s Corona Casino, developed by Phu Quoc Tourism Investment and Development JSC, has been operational since 2019, set within a complex with a total investment exceeding VND50 trillion (US$1.97 billion). It is currently the only casino allowing Vietnamese citizens to gamble.

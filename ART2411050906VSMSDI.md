George Jarvis eyes ONE Championship contract – and title shot – at Friday Fights 85

ONE Championship hopeful George Jarvis is looking to earn not just a US$100,000 contract but a title shot when he returns to Bangkok’s Lumpinee Stadium this weekend.

The 24-year-old Brit faces Rungrawee Sitsongpeenong in a lightweight Muay Thai clash at ONE Friday Fights 84.

After a split decision loss on his September 2023 debut, Jarvis is riding back-to-back wins at ONE Lumpinee, having got the nod from the judges against Mustafa Al Tekreeti and Ricardo Bravo in February and August, respectively, this year.

“G-Unit” now feels he will be hard to ignore for a ONE Championship contract should he beat “Legatron” on Friday.

“This camp has been great,” Jarvis told the Bangkok Post on Tuesday. “It has been nothing but hard work and game planning for Rungrawee.

“ONE cannot deny me if I take out another contracted fighter. We are coming aggressive and looking for the knockout.

With a two-fight win streak of his own under his belt, 28-year-old Thai Rungrawee has called for a shot at Regian Eersel’s lightweight Muay Thai belt if he gets his hand raised again this week.

Rungrawee also seemingly took a dig at two-time ONE lightweight title challenger Sinsamut Klinmee, whom Eersel has beaten twice, when he told the Bangkok Post he was “ready to show who is the best Thai in the division and challenge for the world title”. 

Jarvis seemed to concur with the sentiment – but is looking to steal that title opportunity from under his opponent’s nose.

“He is the top Thai in the division,” Jarvis said. “But after this fight it will be me getting that title shot – not him.”

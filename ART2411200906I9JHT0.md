Kevint Singhsajjatej, General Manager of Jaspal Group, awarded scholarships to the five winners of the Jaspal Group Scholarship Program 2024.

Jaspal Group solidifies its status as a leader in the fashion industry, driving Thailand’s fashion landscape forward with the Jaspal Group Scholarship Programme 2024. Going beyond the award ceremony, the group hosted a captivating runway show that spotlighted the innovative designs of this year’s winners. Themed “The Power of Next,” the programme provided a platform for young designers nationwide to unleash their creativity, breathing fresh energy into Jaspal Group’s iconic brands. 

The comprehensive scholarship programme, valued at over **650,000 THB**, offers winners not only financial support but also hands-on experience through internships with Jaspal Group’s top-tier designers and industry experts. Winners also benefit from tailored coaching sessions aimed at enhancing their industry expertise. 

This year’s five scholarship recipients, each awarded **100,000 THB**, are: 

*   **Khwankhao** **Phanphitthayut** and **Chatchai** **Sriprempun** from Chulalongkorn University
*   **Piyabud** **Waleekeitikul** and **Nichapat** **Kaewthamrong** from Srinakharinwirot University
*   **Mild** **Phrueksakitcharoen** from Thammasat University 

The programme’s highlight was the fashion show, which allowed winners to create and exhibit their own collections, all inspired by the forward-thinking **“The Power of Next”** concept. These collections competed for an additional distinguished scholarship award of 150,000 THB, judged on creativity, production feasibility, aesthetic appeal, and presentation. Esteemed panellists included **Sethapong** **Pawwattana** and **Chanin** **Faikhun**, leading fashion editorial executives, renowned photographer **Punsiri** **Siriwetchapun**, and **Khevin** **Singhsachathet**, General Manager of Jaspal Group. 

**The Winning Collection** 

The top honour went to **Piyabud** **Waleekeitikul**, a Fashion Textiles and Accessories major at Srinakharinwirot University. His collection, **“Active Resurrection,”** designed for **CPS Chaps**, reimagines 1980s sportswear for the 2050s, blending nostalgia with modern sustainability. Drawing inspiration from WGSN’s Design Capsule: Men’s Active Retro 2025, Piyabud incorporated both natural and synthetic materials to enhance comfort and durability, ensuring clothing longevity while maintaining CPS Chaps’s signature grunge-inspired aesthetic. 

**The Other Scholarship Winners** 

*   **Khwankhao** **Phanphitthayut** presented **“Bureau Lounge” A/W 2025** for **Jaspal**, a womenswear line inspired by Brazilian artist Sergio Rodrigues’s iconic furniture. The collection embodies the **“Robust Luxury”** trend and the keyword **“Intelligent Simplicity,”** offering sustainable, timeless pieces that transition seamlessly from professional wear to wardrobe staples.
*   **Chatchai** **Sriprempun** introduced **“ROCKS SS 2025”** for **CPS Chaps**, merging the natural durability of denim with modular designs. His collection redefines “rock” as both a musical rhythm and a timeless element of nature, emphasising sustainability through innovative fabric use.
*   **Nichapat** **Kaewthamrong** created **“Modern Euphoria: The Precious Happiness of Women’s Individuality”** for **Jaspal**, celebrating feminine individuality through a bold mix of textures and styles, from lace tops to leather jackets. The collection bridges femininity and masculinity, empowering women to express their unique identities.
*   **Mild** **Phrueksakitcharoen** designed **“Infinite Bloom”** for **Lyn Around**, inspired by the striking hues of the Aganisia Cyanea Orchid. Her playful yet elegant collection incorporates floral patterns and youthful silhouettes, crafted from breathable fabrics like cotton and organdy. 

Congratulations to the winners of the **Jaspal Group Scholarship** **Programme** **2024****!** Their talent and creativity set the stage for a brighter future in Thailand’s fashion industry.

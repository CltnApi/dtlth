Maurice Lacroix Unveils Limited Edition AIKON with Pond Review

Maurice Lacroix, the renowned Swiss luxury watch brand, once again stirs excitement with the release of a special edition timepiece: the Maurice Lacroix X Pond Review AIKON Automatic Limited Edition 39mm. This model embodies the brand’s belief that the modern urban lifestyle is all about uniqueness, self-expression, and carving out a personal path. Maurice Lacroix expresses this philosophy: “Rather than following others, individuals proudly wear watches they select and cherish. Although popular models, they must possess a clear, unique distinction.” Over the years, Maurice Lacroix has continuously captured collectors' interest with special edition models that showcase boundless creativity, and this release is no exception. 

The collaboration centres on Thai YouTuber Pond, a leading watch reviewer with over 200,000 subscribers on his channel, "Pond Review." Driven by a deep-seated passion for timepieces, Pond’s channel has flourished over the past five years, during which he has reviewed over 2,000 watches, including more than 70 Maurice Lacroix models. His first Maurice Lacroix was the AIKON Automatic 39mm in blue, which he featured as the brand’s debut review on his channel, introducing Maurice Lacroix to his followers. Since then, his admiration for the brand has only grown, and his reviews have maintained a strong presence on the channel, strengthening his connection with the Maurice Lacroix community.

**A Special Timepiece Close to the Heart** 

Fuelled by its belief that the modern urban lifestyle demands uniqueness, Maurice Lacroix values fresh perspectives from enthusiasts who resonate with the brand’s vision. This openness to ideas from fans around the globe has been integral to Maurice Lacroix’s commitment to Swiss luxury and precision. Among the many Maurice Lacroix watches reviewed by Pond, his passion and distinctive perspective led him to develop a unique design concept he kept private—until a collaboration conversation with Maurice Lacroix ignited the creation of this special project. 

The result is the Maurice Lacroix X Pond Review AIKON Automatic Limited Edition 39mm, the first collaborative timepiece designed by Pond and Maurice Lacroix. This special edition is distinguished by striking details: a gold Maurice Lacroix "M" logo, a red seconds hand set against a white Clous de Paris dial, a blue chapter ring, and the “Pond Review” logo engraved on the smoky gradient sapphire crystal case back. Notably, this is the first 39mm AIKON model with a white dial, while the red, white, and blue accents are inspired by both the beloved Gundam robot and the colours of the Thai flag. 

The watch also debuts a gold logo on the AIKON model, a homage to Thailand’s cultural icon, the Golden Bell, as Pond explains. Enhancing its style is a cool grey rubber strap, lending a refined, smart aesthetic that fits seamlessly with any outfit or occasion. The piece is presented as part of an exclusive box set, which includes an interchangeable stainless steel strap, ideal for those with active urban lifestyles. 

The Maurice Lacroix X Pond Review AIKON Automatic Limited Edition 39mm is limited to only 250 pieces worldwide, with just 150 available in Thailand. For the first 100 pre-orders, customers will receive an exclusive watch winder, specially designed by Pond Review to celebrate this remarkable collaboration.

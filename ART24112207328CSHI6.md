UA Combine has proven to be a popular event.

Under Armour has brought the UA Combine 2024, powered by Supersports, Southeast Asia's largest physical performance competition, back to Bangkok, and the event is set to electrify Central Ladprao tomorrow.

In its third consecutive year, the UA Combine has already set records before even beginning. Registration slots vanished in mere moments following its spectacular press conference in July, showcasing the sheer excitement and unmatched enthusiasm for this adrenaline-charged event.

This year's edition promises to be an electrifying showcase of athletic talent, testing participants across eight core physical skills based on US standards: agility, stamina, vertical, power, endurance, strength, speed, and cognition. Only the most balanced and strongest competitor will claim the ultimate victory, walking away with a total prize pool of over 500,000 baht.

Adding to the excitement, this year's event will feature an all-star line-up of renowned athletes and celebrities, including renowned boxer Suppachai "Superbon" Meunsang, basketball star Watcharachat "Aong" Tongpakdee, national basketball player Pimchosita "Kat" Supyen, national track and field athlete Nutthapong "Mac" Veeravongratanasiri, bodybuilding expert Worakorn "Champ" Wongsakornmaeng, along with Nicha "Wawwa" Chokprajakchat, Matthew Dean, Pattrakorn "Ploy" Tungsupakul, and many more.

The UA Combine 2024, powered by Supersports, is set to take place from 10am-9pm tomorrow at BCC Hall, fifth floor, Central Ladprao.

Admission is free. Attendees can look forward to exciting activities, engaging games, and exclusive giveaways throughout the day.

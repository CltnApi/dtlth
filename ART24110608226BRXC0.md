Early Career and Prominent Roles
--------------------------------

Pimchanok Luevisadpaibul, known as Baifern, was born on September 30, 1992, in Bangkok, Thailand. She attended Thep Aksorn School and later earned a bachelor’s degree in fine arts from Srinakharinwirot University, majoring in acting and directing.

Interestingly, Baifern’s childhood passion was far removed from the entertainment world. She dedicated much of her early years to training in rhythmic gymnastics, winning multiple medals throughout her high school career.

Her entry into the entertainment industry began when she was in the 6th grade, after being approached by a modelling agency. She began her career with commercial modelling and small acting roles in short films, such as _Mr Asoke and Ms Ploenchit_ (2003) and _The Sanctuary of Sea_ (2007). Baifern continued to pursue acting, appearing in several films before landing her breakthrough role in _Crazy Little Thing Called Love_.

In 2010, Baifern became a national sensation with her portrayal of Nam in _Crazy Little Thing Called Love_, a romantic comedy about two high school students, Nam and Chon, played by Mario Maurer. The film was an instant hit in Thailand and won B_est Movie of the Year_ in 2010. Baifern’s performance earned her nominations for _Best Actress_ and the _Top Actress Award_, and she won the _Favourite Film Rising Star Female_ award.

Notable Roles
-------------

Baifern continued to shine with roles in various television dramas, including _Lhong Fai_ (2017), where she portrayed Kan Kaew, a determined office worker whose ambition for financial success leads her down a morally complicated path involving relationships with different men. This series, adapted from a novel by Krisana Asoksin, has been made into both a movie and television series multiple times. Baifern’s compelling performance earned her the _Best New Actress_ award at the 9th Nataraja Awards.

Baifern’s latest television drama, _The Lady and Her Lovers_, tells the story of a woman who moves to Bangkok in search of a better life. With her beauty and ambition, she uses her relationships with several men as a means to rise to wealth and glamour. Baifern stars alongside Jespipat Tilapornputt, creating captivating onscreen chemistry that has fuelled rumours about a potential real-life relationship. These speculations were further heightened when Jespipat attended Baifern’s recent birthday party. However, Jespipat quickly clarified that they are just friends.

Beyond the Screen
-----------------

In addition to her acting career, Baifern’s elegant sense of style has garnered her significant attention in the fashion industry. She made headlines across Thailand and internationally when she became the first Southeast Asian ambassador for LOEWE. Her first official appearance as the brand’s ambassador was at the Crafted World exhibition in Shanghai in March 2024. Before her ambassadorial role, Baifern also participated in LOEWE’s Spring/Summer 2025 collection.

This year, Baifern added another feather to her cap, becoming the first Thai female representative for the prestigious Tiffany & Co. Her growing influence in the fashion world, combined with her stunning looks and impressive acting career, has not only made her a household name in Thailand but also established her as a significant figure on the international stage.

Baifern’s journey from a young gymnast to one of Thailand’s most recognised actresses and fashion icons is a testament to her versatility, talent, and relentless drive. As her career continues to evolve, Baifern remains one of the most influential figures in the entertainment and fashion industries, both in Thailand and beyond.

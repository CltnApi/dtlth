Sorawong said the past week saw a surge in both short- and long-haul tourists.

He said 243,204 long-haul tourists arrived in Thailand over the past week, up 24.85% from the previous week. This is the first time since March that the number of long-haul tourists was more than 200,000, he added. The minister attributed this surge to the start of the holiday season in Europe, America and Oceania.

Sorawong added that short-haul tourists rose by 17.72% last week because of long holidays for Diwali in several countries, including India, Malaysia and Singapore.

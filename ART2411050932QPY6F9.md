EVA Air Launches 24/7 Bilingual Global Customer Support

EVA Air has officially launched its 24/7 global customer service, offering around-the-clock support exclusively in Chinese and English by calling local customer service line.

EVA Air has officially launched its 24/7 global customer service, offering around-the-clock support exclusively in Chinese and English, making it the first airline in Taiwan to provide this level of service. Passengers around the world can now call their local EVA Air customer service line anytime for assistance in Chinese or English, while support in other local languages remains available during regular service hours. For more information on EVA Air’s global service network, please visit [www.evaair.com](http://www.evaair.com/).

This new 24/7 bilingual service represents a significant advancement in EVA Air’s commitment to delivering timely, professional assistance, ensuring a smoother and more secure travel experience for passengers worldwide. 

In line with its commitment to enhancing the passenger experience, EVA Air introduced an AI chatbot in Traditional Chinese in 2019. The chatbot can answer over 500 frequently asked questions on topics such as bookings, flight schedules, baggage allowances, and airport information. The airline also launched AI chatbot services with live chat in Traditional Chinese for more in-depth assistance and plans to expand live chat services in additional languages. 

To further improve customer experience, EVA Air implemented the GENESYS system in 2022, introducing a “virtual queue” feature. Passengers can now opt for a callback, allowing the system to hold their place in line and receive a callback in the original queue order, reducing hold times significantly. 

This year, EVA Air was ranked 8th among the World’s Best Airlines by SKYTRAX and has received SKYTRAX’s prestigious 5-Star Airline rating for nine consecutive years. Additionally, it was voted number 9 in the Best International Airlines category by US readers of Condé Nast Traveler. EVA Air continues to demonstrate its dedication to service innovation and delivering an outstanding travel experience for passengers worldwide.

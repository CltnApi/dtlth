HONG KONG: Hundreds queued on Tuesday outside a Hong Kong court ahead of the sentencing of 45 pro-democracy activists in a landmark national security trial that has damaged the city's once feisty pro-democracy movement and drawn international criticism.

A total of 47 pro-democracy activists were arrested and charged in 2021 with conspiracy to commit subversion under a Beijing-imposed national security law. The charges related to the organising of an unofficial "primary election" in 2020 to select the best candidates for an upcoming legislative election.

The activists were accused by prosecutors of plotting to paralyse the government by engaging in potentially disruptive acts had they been elected.

Police formed a tight security cordon for several blocks around the West Kowloon Magistrates Court, as several hundred supporters queued while holding up umbrellas in a light rain to try to secure a seat within the main courtroom and several spillover courts.

"I feel such an injustice needs witnessing," said Margaret, 59, dressed in a white raincoat and black facemask, who was in the queue since Sunday afternoon. "I've long followed their case. They (the democrats) need to know they still have public support."

After a 118 day trial, 14 of the democrats were found guilty in May, including Australian citizen Gordon Ng and activist Owen Chow, while two were acquitted.

The other 31 pleaded guilty, including student activist **Joshua Wong** and alleged mastermind, legal scholar Benny Tai. They could receive jail terms of several years to life by the three hand-picked national security judges when the hearing commences at 0200 GMT.

The US has criticised the trial as "politically motivated" and said the democrats should be released as they had been "peacefully participating in political activities" that were legal.

The Chinese and Hong Kong governments say the national security laws were necessary to restore order after mass pro-democracy protests in 2019, and the democrats have been treated in accordance with local laws.

Some supporters including Raphael Wong, a member of the League of Social Democrats - a pro-democracy group - were questioned by the police and had their bags searched.

"We have no plans to protest today because we want to go inside for the sentencing," he told Reuters.

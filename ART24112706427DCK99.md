ICONSIAM, the iconic global destination on Bangkok's Chao Phraya River, has solidified its reputation as a world-class landmark, earning the prestigious ICONIC THAI BRAND AWARD and recognition for Blue by Alain Ducasse among Asia’s Top 100 Restaurants by Tatler Asia.

These accolades underscore ICONSIAM’s role in blending Thailand’s cultural heritage with international excellence, offering visitors unparalleled experiences. The Michelin-starred Blue by Alain Ducasse, a hallmark of ICONSIAM’s dedication to culinary artistry, has retained its one Michelin star since 2021 and now joins Tatler Asia’s prestigious Top 100 list, reinforcing Thailand’s global culinary standing.

A flagship development by Siam Piwat in partnership with Charoen Pokphand Group (CP) and Magnolia Quality Development Corporation (MQDC), ICONSIAM has garnered over 38 international awards in just six years. Its innovative concepts and commitment to sustainability have established it as a symbol of Thai excellence, attracting visitors from around the world.

The recent Tatler Best 2024 ceremony further highlighted ICONSIAM’s stature, featuring an exclusive collaboration between Chef Wilfrid Hocquet of Blue by Alain Ducasse and Chef Joris Rousseau of Hong Kong’s Green Star-awarded Feuille. The duo presented an exquisite menu combining premium French techniques with local Thai flavours, showcasing the best of both worlds.

With these achievements, ICONSIAM continues to set new benchmarks for luxury, culture, and gastronomy, ensuring its place as a cornerstone of Thailand’s global identity.

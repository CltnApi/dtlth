Big Bang Unico Novak Djokovic

The Big Bang Unico Novak Djokovic celebrates the legendary mindset of the 24-time Grand Slam champion and Olympic gold medalist. Inspired by Djokovic’s unparalleled achievements, Hublot has created a watch that blends cutting-edge innovation with sustainable craftsmanship.

This exceptional timepiece incorporates recycled materials from Djokovic’s HEAD racquets and Lacoste polos, symbolising his agility and determination. Lightweight yet resilient, the watch features a unique camo aesthetic and innovative components, including an aluminium Unico chronograph movement and tempered Gorilla glass.

Launched in Paris with Hublot CEO Julien Tornare and Novak Djokovic himself, the limited-edition watch (100 pieces) reflects Djokovic’s extraordinary legacy. With four interchangeable straps and meticulous details such as tennis-inspired bezel screws, it’s a must-have for collectors and fans alike.

Each watch comes in a sustainably sourced oak box and includes a signed Lacoste polo and sport wristband. Experience this one-of-a-kind tribute, available now at Hublot boutiques and Hublot.com.

Mitr Phol Sugar Corporation Limited, one of the world’s largest sugar producers, has reinforced its commitment to sustainability by winning the Top Sustainability Advocates in Asia award at the Asia Corporate Excellence & Sustainability Awards 2024 (ACES Awards 2024). This prestigious accolade highlights the company’s exceptional efforts in embedding sustainability into its business practices, with a strong emphasis on social and environmental responsibility. 

The award was presented to Mr Verajet Vongkusolkit, Chief Executive Officer of the Thai Sugar, Energy and New Business Group at Mitr Phol Group, on behalf of the company. This achievement affirms Mitr Phol’s ongoing dedication to sustainable business practices, bolstering its leadership position in the industry and earning it well-deserved recognition. 

The ACES Awards, organised by MORS Group, aim to promote business development and sustainable growth across Asia. They serve as a platform for corporate leaders to exchange knowledge and best practices, encouraging organisational excellence and sustainability. This year, over 682 companies from the Asia region participated in the selection process, with more than 88 Thai companies represented. 

Mitr Phol’s recognition as Top Sustainability Advocates in Asia reflects its impressive track record in driving sustainability across its operations. Key achievements include: 

*   Community Empowerment: The company promotes educational opportunities and youth empowerment through its Partnership School project. It fosters equality and inclusion by providing employment opportunities for people with disabilities and tailoring skills development programmes to their abilities. Through its Safe Vegetable Growing initiative, Mitr Phol ensures food security in local communities while sourcing products from local growers near its factories. This initiative improves product quality, creates stable markets, and generated over 3.3 million baht in community income in 2023. 
    

*   Workplace: Mitr Phol has cultivated an organisational culture that values diversity, fosters innovation, and ensures a safe, supportive working environment. Open communication is prioritised through regular feedback channels, while various programmes encourage employees to explore creative ideas and technological advancements. 
    

*   Climate Action: The company is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It utilises renewable energy derived from sugar production by-products, including biomass energy and ethanol. Mitr Phol’s eco-friendly innovations, such as the Mitr Phol ModernFarm, integrate sustainable practices into sugarcane farming and production processes. A notable achievement is the Mitr Phol Dan Chang complex in Suphanburi province, Thailand’s first carbon-neutral industrial site, which also generates carbon credits through voluntary greenhouse gas reduction projects. 
    

By championing community empowerment, fostering workplace innovation, and leading climate action, Mitr Phol continues to set a benchmark for sustainable practices in the industry. This recognition underscores the company’s vision for a sustainable future, built on a foundation of responsibility and excellence.

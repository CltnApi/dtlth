PROUD Real Estate Public Company Limited continues to lead Thailand's property sector with its commitment to sustainable living, as InterContinental Residences Hua Hin becomes the nation’s first move-in-ready condominium and the world’s first InterContinental-branded condominium to achieve the esteemed Fitwel Built Certification. With wellness-focused standards and resident care at the forefront, PROUD is dedicated to incorporating globally recognised principles into upcoming projects, including VEHHA Hua Hin and ROMM Convent, both anticipated to be certified in Q1 2025. This achievement underscores PROUD's philosophy of holistic, sustainable living under its "ALL IS WELL" approach.

Ms. Proudputh Liptapanlop, Director of PROUD, stated, “Proud Real Estate is setting a new standard in Thailand’s real estate industry with Fitwel certification across all projects, aiming to provide a superior living experience that extends beyond exceptional construction and design to health-promoting services and activities. The globally recognised Fitwel standard, developed by the U.S. CDC in collaboration with the GSA, embodies our commitment to resident well-being.”

The InterContinental Residences Hua Hin has received Fitwel Built Certification in the Multifamily Residential category, making it Thailand’s first certified condominium upon completion and occupancy, as well as the first globally under the InterContinental brand (as listed in the Fitwel Directory: [Fitwel Directory](https://www.fitwel.org/project-directory)). Projects VEHHA Hua Hin and ROMM Convent are in progress and expected to be certified in Q1 2025.

Joanna Frank, President & CEO of the Center for Active Design, praised PROUD's efforts: “PROUD Real Estate’s commitment to Fitwel sets a new benchmark for health and well-being in Thailand’s property sector, enhancing residents' quality of life and cultivating sustainability and community engagement."

Beyond Fitwel certification, PROUD is dedicated to wellness standards throughout project lifespans, with internal teams being trained as Fitwel Ambassadors to maintain high wellness standards. The company has also partnered with Bangkok Hospital for resident emergency assistance training and continues to offer wellness-focused activities across its projects. This commitment goes beyond traditional real estate, with each "ALL IS WELL" project crafted to provide more than just homes—creating environments that support residents' health and well-being.

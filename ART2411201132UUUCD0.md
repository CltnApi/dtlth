The three-day “WHA Open House 2024: Explore – Discover – Shape the Future”, which runs until Friday, reveals all aspects of its business ecosystem through exhibitions and special seminars featuring executives, experts and business partners.

The event also showcases its business capabilities and delves into cutting-edge innovations and technologies across its four core business groups – logistics, industrial estates, utilities and power, and digital solutions.

Somkid Jatusripitak, WHA chairman of the board of directors, said at the opening ceremony that the Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, climate change and rapid digital transformation had disrupted people’s lives and business operations.

To cope with these challenges, WHA has shifted its business goals from being solely profit-driven to focusing on sustainability, creation of community value and comprehensive digital transformation.

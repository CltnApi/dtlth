While product quality and price are the primary factors that win brand loyalty from Thai moms—up to 79% are loyal to a brand because of these factors—service quality is the real game-changer. It’s a key driver that could cause them to abandon a brand. Only 36% of moms will stick with a brand if they receive satisfactory service, but if the service is disappointing, 43% of loyal moms are ready to “converse” with other brands.

According to the Digital Mom Survey 2024 by theAsianparent Thailand, which delves into online spending habits of digital-era moms across various platforms, the most popular product category among Thai moms is baby care products, with 48% of moms purchasing them online, especially items crucial to their children’s health and hygiene. Household and electronic items come next at 24%, followed by clothing and apparel at 14%, and health and beauty products at 9%. On average, moms spend around 1,500-3,000 THB monthly on online shopping.

Additionally, moms tend to be cost-conscious regarding shipping fees. As a result, free shipping for high-quality products with added promotions and discounts has a strong influence on their purchase decisions.

When it comes to online purchasing criteria, most moms prioritise promotions, discounts, and price (54%) over product quality (14%), user reviews (14%), and free shipping (14%). Factors that influence product or brand choice before making a purchase include expert recommendations (87%), followed by word-of-mouth from family, relatives, or friends (83%), product demonstrations (70%), and real experiences shared by other moms in online communities (69%). Notably, influencers and KOL endorsements have the least impact on Thai moms’ purchase decisions at 47%.

Key drivers for Thai moms’ purchasing decisions include product quality (87%), price (67%), and the impact on their families (34%), while online reviews account for only 25%.

When examining brand loyalty, service quality emerges as a sensitive factor influencing spending choices among moms. If satisfied with the service, 36% will continue to buy, but if the service is subpar, up to 43% are likely to switch to a competing brand with similar quality, more stable pricing, and better service. In cases where prices rise, moms are particularly inclined to switch brands.

Moreover, today’s moms prioritise health and environmental factors in their product choices, showing an increasing interest in organic and eco-friendly options. Alongside quality, price, and service, these environmental factors can play a significant role in fostering brand loyalty, as meeting these demands can create a lasting impression that leads to repeat purchases.

**Quality, Service, and Trust Shape Thai Moms' Spending Choices**

Thai moms, especially regular online shoppers, are willing to spend more on high-value products or in bulk purchases. On average, they place about two online orders per month. Shopee is the top platform for moms at 57%, with many buying weekly, averaging 1,500-5,000 THB per month. TikTok Shop follows at 22%, with moms increasingly frequenting this platform, even though the average spend per purchase is lower than on Shopee. TikTok Shop is rapidly gaining popularity, with many moms buying there weekly.

For parenting information, Thai moms primarily rely on websites (65%), communities (30%), and apps (20%), with a strong interest in topics like nutrition (53%), screen time (49%), and social media (48%). Facebook and TikTok are the primary platforms where moms gather information about products, with Facebook being especially effective for brands to communicate and build relationships with this audience.

Nine out of ten moms agree that a brand’s communication across multiple channels is essential to engage them and influences their purchase decisions. The key elements moms look for from brands are clarity on the benefits for their children, product safety, and value for money (81%), followed by perceived value (44%) and first-hand experiences from other moms (39%). When brands effectively convey this information, it can significantly encourage purchase decisions.

In addition to brand messaging, trust and helpful recommendations are also vital to moms’ buying choices. The most influential figures are other moms who have used the product, with 63% relying on these experiences, followed by expert recommendations (59%), product photos and descriptions (58%), and product demonstration videos (34%).

Overall, the decision-making process for Thai moms differs slightly from their research base for evaluating products, where expert opinions weigh higher (87%) compared to experiences shared by other moms (69%).

Given the current economic climate, Thai moms consistently prioritise quality, price, and service satisfaction as the top factors in their purchasing decisions for their children, themselves, and their families. These are the core expectations every brand needs to address effectively.

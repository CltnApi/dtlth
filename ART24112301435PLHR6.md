The wait is over for the exclusive event that art toy collectors and enthusiasts must not miss. **Molly Factory Studio**, in collaboration with **Siam Paragon** and **Siam Center**, is offering an unparalleled experience, reinforcing its position as a top-of-mind global destination.

Together, they transform spaces into sanctuaries of comfort and new beginnings through the creative vision of ‘**Molly’** or **‘Mod** - **Nisa Srikamdee**,’ a world-renowned artist presenting the much-beloved and one of the most sought-after art toy characters.

This event takes everyone on an emotional healing journey, reflecting the growth and transformation within ‘Molly,’ the artist behind the beloved characters “**CryBunny**” and “**CryTeddy**.”

For the first time, these giant adorable characters are showcased at S**iam Paragon x CryBunny** “**Letting Go**” at **Parc Paragon**, alongside **Siam Center x CryTeddy** “**Holding On**” on the G floor of **Siam Center**. The event is packed with surprise activities and special limited-edition collections available exclusively at Siam Paragon and Siam Center.

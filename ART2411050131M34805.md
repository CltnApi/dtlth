As Thailand stands at the cusp of a digital revolution, the potential of 5G technology to reshape industries, bolster the economy, and elevate society as a whole has never been more evident. With a rich 118-year legacy in the country, Ericsson Thailand is proud to be leading this wave of transformation with 5G. Based on its world-class expertise in 5G, Ericsson is playing a pivotal role in driving digitalisation and empowering Thailand to unlock the full potential of its digital economy. It is supporting Thailand’s journey to become a digital economy and emerge as a leading digital hub in Southeast Asia.

In today’s world, 5G technology is much more than just an upgrade from previous generations of wireless technology. It is the foundation upon which future innovations will be built. Offering lightning-fast speeds, ultra-low latency, and unparalleled reliability, 5G has the power to transform industries, revolutionise business models, and enhance the daily lives of millions. Ericsson’s 5G solutions are programmable, secured, reliable, efficient, and sustainable, making us the trusted partner for mobile operators and enterprises globally.

“Ericsson is a technology leader in 5G. We have been investing for cost and performance leadership, which has enabled us to also bring sustainable solutions to our customers, the Thai Service providers. Ericsson powers over 166 5G networks across 69 countries and around 50% of 5G traffic outside of China runs on our networks. We can today modernise legacy 4G sites with 5G achieving 10 times improved capacity and more than 30 percent energy savings,” states Anders Rian, Head of Ericsson Thailand.

TRANSFORMING ENTERPRISES: POWERING THAILAND’S INDUSTRY 4.0

As Thailand gears up for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0), the importance of advanced digital infrastructure cannot be overstated. Industries are increasingly turning to digital solutions to optimise operations, reduce costs, and increase productivity. 5G is positively disrupting and transforming enterprises and enabling enterprise digital transformation at scale and speed. 5G is the common thread underpinning the success of new and exciting enterprise use cases and solutions due to its wider range, higher reliability, and lower latency. Enterprise is where we see the opportunity to grow long term, and the opportunity for a value-creating transformational shift for the industry.

Thailand’s manufacturing sector, a key driver of the economy, is poised for a digital revolution. Smart factories, powered by IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence), will redefine how manufacturers operate. Automated systems, enhanced by real-time data analytics, will improve everything from logistics to production, helping businesses enhance efficiency, cut costs, and ultimately increase profitability.

“Ericsson’s global expertise in co-creation ensures that we can partner closely with enterprises to understand their unique challenges and develop tailored solutions that maximise the benefits of digitalisation. From smart warehouses to AI-enabled production lines, we are helping businesses prepare for a future where connectivity drives competitiveness,” Anders said.

5G FOR CONSUMERS: REDEFINING THE MOBILE EXPERIENCE

While industries undergo transformation, consumers in Thailand are also witnessing a shift in how they experience mobile technology. As digital services become more integral to everyday life, people demand faster, more reliable, and more immersive digital experiences. 

With Ericsson’s 5G technology, consumers will experience ultra-high-speed mobile broadband that supports data-intensive applications like high-definition streaming, immersive AR/VR experiences, and provides more immersive experiences. 5G brings with it ultra-low latency, making real-time interactions possible in ways that 4G simply could not deliver. For the avid gamer, this means seamless, lag-free experiences.

Mobile broadband usage is soaring across the globe, and Thailand is no exception. By 2025, 5G subscriptions are expected to rise to 45 million out of nearly 100 million subscribers. Fast forward to 2030, and 5G is forecast to account for a staggering 94% of all mobile subscriptions, with over 103 million 5G subscribers. These figures highlight the speed and scale of Thailand’s 5G adoption, driven by consumers’ growing demand for high-speed, uninterrupted mobile connectivity.

But this growth is about more than just faster internet speeds. 5G is unlocking new opportunities for businesses and consumers alike. In fact, it is predicted that 5G will generate $7.3 billion in enterprise opportunities for mobile operators, especially in sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, automotive, and utilities. This is the future we are helping to build in Thailand—one where 5G is the backbone of a thriving digital economy.

SUSTAINABILITY AT THE CORE OF OUR 5G SOLUTIONS

At Ericsson, sustainability is embedded in everything we do. Our “breaking the energy curve” approach demonstrates our commitment to building energy-efficient, eco-friendly networks, states Anders Rian.

Scaling up 5G while reducing the total network energy consumption requires Service Providers to focus on sustainable network evolution, modernise the existing network effectively and leverage artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) and automation to maximise traffic performance of deployed hardware with minimised energy use. “Ericsson believes that mobile networks need to be planned, built and operated with precision. By taking a holistic view of network evolution, expansion and operation, we have advanced our approach to break the upward trajectory of energy consumption in mobile networks. We are well equipped to support Thai CSPs in keeping energy use and carbon emissions at a minimum, with zero-touch problem solving and predictive energy management,” states Anders Rian.

As data traffic on the network varies daily, the use of energy-saving applications is fundamental to adjusting the capacity of mobile networks to match demand and to delivering the best user experience with the lowest energy use. This can be achieved through a portfolio of tools and capabilities including the latest artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) – as well as automation solutions which can help to reduce perceived complexity barriers.

Thailand’s ambition to become a regional digital hub is supported by the availability of affordable, diverse, and flexible digital infrastructure. Ericsson is proud to be a driving force behind this effort, helping the country develop the key pillars that are essential for creating a digital economy. This includes building the digital infrastructure—high-speed 5G connectivity that connects more people than ever before; creating an open, enabling ecosystem that fosters innovation and supports both new and established businesses; and nurturing digital skills by developing a tech-savvy workforce equipped with the knowledge and expertise needed to thrive in a digital world.

The promise of 5G is clear: It has the potential to become the dominant access technology, transforming the way people and industries connect. By 2029, mobile data traffic per active smartphone in Southeast Asia and Oceania is expected to rise to 42 GB per month, an average growth of 16% from 2023 levels. In Thailand, 5G will enable unparalleled opportunities in areas such as healthcare, manufacturing, utilities, and more, supporting the country’s economic recovery and long-term growth.

A PARTNER IN THAILAND’S DIGITAL JOURNEY

Ericsson is committed to ensuring the digital transformation of Thailand. As a trusted global partner, Ericsson is accelerating ecosystem development, driving innovation, and co-creating solutions that will empower businesses and consumers alike. “By educating and empowering talents, capturing the full value of 5G, and learning from proven global success cases, we are positioning Thailand to thrive in the digital era. Together with our stakeholders, we will build a resilient, sustainable, and connected future for the country,” Anders concludes.

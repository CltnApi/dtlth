Held annually in November, the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Genève (GPHG) awards ceremony honours outstanding creations in the watchmaking world. The 20 or so prizes include the most prestigious Aiguille d'Or Grand Prix (Best in Show).

This year IWC Schaffhausen won the Aiguille d'Or Grand Prix for its Portugieser Eternal Calendar at the 24th GPHG awards ceremony, which took place on Nov 13 at Théâtre du Léman in Geneva.

"We are thrilled to win this award for the Portugieser Eternal Calendar. Building on the emblematic crown-controlled perpetual calendar that Kurt Klaus developed in the 1980s, we have pushed the limits for mechanical calendar complications once again," said Christoph Grainger-Herr, CEO of IWC Schaffhausen.

Kurt Klaus, who turned 90 on Oct 26, worked at IWC for more than four decades.

The legendary watchmaker devised the user-friendly Da Vinci Perpetual Calendar Chronograph, which debuted at the Basel watch fair in 1985.

All of its displays could be advanced simply by turning the crown, a first in the industry. In addition to recognising the different lengths of the months, the mechanical programme automatically inserted a leap day every four years, thus working without any manual adjustments until the year 2100.

Klaus was also involved in the development of the Portugieser Perpetual Calendar with an enhanced moon phase accuracy of 577.5 years and the Da Vinci Perpetual Calendar Digital Date-Month, respectively launched in 2003 and 2009.

IWC built on this expertise and developed the Portugieser Eternal Calendar as its first secular perpetual calendar.

The award-winning timepiece is based on the same modular and synchronised design as IWC's perpetual calendar, meaning that all displays can be advanced simply by using the crown.

However, while the perpetual calendar is programmed for a four-year cycle with three regular years followed by a leap year, the Portugieser Eternal Calendar accounts for the Gregorian calendar's leap year exceptions.

A newly-engineered 400-year gear ensures that the secular perpetual calendar automatically skips three leap years over four centuries. This means it will calculate the leap year correctly until at least the year 3999.

Thanks to a newly-developed reduction gear train with three intermediate wheels, the Double Moon indication will theoretically only deviate from the lunar orbit by one day after 45,361,055 years.

"We have engineered more than just a concept. Despite its tremendous complexity, the Portugieser Eternal Calendar is a watch we are actually producing, and our customers are wearing every day," said IWC's CEO.

Housed in a platinum case, the Portugieser Eternal Calendar features box-glass sapphire crystals on the front and the back that showcase the transparent glass dial and the IWC-manufactured 52640 calibre.

"My thanks go to our teams in research and innovation, design and development, simulation and testing, and, of course, manufacturing. This watch would not have been possible without your passion and determination," he said.

IWC dates back to 1868, when Florentine Ariosto Jones established the International Watch Company in Schaffhausen in northeastern Switzerland.

The American watchmaker drew on Swiss horological expertise, modern technology and hydropower sourced from the River Rhine to manufacture high-quality pocket watches.

Today, with collections like the Portugieser and the Pilot's Watches, IWC covers the whole spectrum from elegant to sports watches.

Its Pilot's Watch Performance Chronograph 41 Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team and Big Pilot's Watch 43 Tourbillon Markus Bühler were also respectively nominated in the Sports and Iconic categories of the GPHG 2024 competition.

Two-goal hero: Sukhothai's Matheus Fornazari celebrates.

Sukhothai put on an impressive show to hammer Nongbua Pitchaya 5-2 in a Thai League 1 clash on Friday night.

Playing at their home ground, the Fire Bats went ahead in the third minute through John Baggio before Matheus Fornazari doubled Sukhothai's advantage two minutes later.

Nongbua did not give in and closed the gap in the 10th minute when Abo Eisa found the net for the visitors. They came close to equalising shortly before the break but Paolo Conrado's shot missed the target by a whisker.

Sukhothai were quick to wrest back control in the second half and Fornazari grabbed his second goal of the night with a thundering header in the 48th minute.

In the 76th minute, Nongbua got the second goal from Chawin Srichai to make it 3-2.

However, ten minutes later, the hosts Sukhothai struck again when Abdulhafiz Bueraheng and Hikaru Matsui added goals to Sukhothai's tally late in the match.

Sukhothai have moved up to fourth place in the Thai League 1 standings with 20 points, while Nongbua Pitchaya remain in ninth place with 15 points.

Sukhothai coach Akkataporn Chalittaporn said after the game: "It was a good and exciting game. The players stuck to the tactics and we knew we could stifle our opponents' attacks.

"However, we need to be more stable and accurate. Today, we played perfectly, but we have to be consistent."

Twice Grammy-nominated trumpet superstar Ibrahim Maalouf will perform live in Bangkok for the first time at Lido Connect, Rama I Road, on Nov 26 at 7.30pm.

Presented by Live Promotions with the support by the French embassy, the concert is part of Maalouf's highly anticipated "Trumpets Of Michel Ange (T.O.M.A.) Tour".

Maalouf is a French-Lebanese trumpeter and composer whose music transcends boundaries, blending the rich traditions of the Middle East with the modernity of jazz, pop and world music.

Born in Beirut and raised in Paris, Maalouf's unique sound is shaped by his life journey, combining influences from different cultures, creating something entirely new and captivating and speaking to the heart and soul. His innovative use of the quarter-tone trumpet, invented by his father, enables him to weave together Western and Middle Eastern scales in a way that few other musicians can.

Maalouf performed in some of the world's most prestigious venues and has collaborated with renowned artists such as Sting, Quincy Jones and Stevie Wonder.

With 16 albums and performances in over 40 countries and two Grammy nominations in 2023 and 2024, Maalouf's ability to connect with audiences from different cultural backgrounds has made him one of the most beloved musicians of his generation.

The upcoming show will be a philosophical and musical adventure, with Maalouf's trumpet leading the charge alongside a talented ensemble of eight musicians.

Together, they will create a soundscape that is sophisticated yet accessible, ensuring that this concert will be a remarkable experience for audiences in Bangkok.

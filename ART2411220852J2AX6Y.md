Heavier rainfall is affecting Thailand's southern region at least until Saturday, following a downpour that left municipality of Phatthalung province underwater on Friday morning.

The Meteorological Department reported on Friday that a northeasterly wind across the Gulf of Thailand is gathering pace and bringing more rain to all provinces along the gulf from Chumphon to Narathiwat, as well as Prachuap Khiri Khan, until Saturday or possibly longer.

Ranong, Phangnga, Phuket, Krabi, Trang and Satun provinces on the Andaman coast will also be impacted by the wind, the agency added.

Provinces along the gulf have already experienced heavy downpours since Tuesday, prompting authorities to remain alert for flooding.

According to the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department, Phatthalung endured the most rainfall on Thursday. The downpour submerged some areas in Muang, Kongra and Sri Nakarin districts, causing traffic congestion during the morning rush hour.

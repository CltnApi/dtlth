Artists and art enthusiasts gathered recently for the grand opening of THM Art Space—a new hangout for art lovers in Samut Prakan’s Srinakarin.

Founded by Vichitpong Nithilertwiwat and Thiwarit Vikraichayakura, owners of The Happy Maison, the space is designed for artists, art enthusiasts, and people of all ages who appreciate art to meet, exchange ideas, and create together.

Vichitpong highlighted the unique appeal of the space, saying, “We aim to make art more accessible to everyone, removing the need to always travel to the city to see galleries. THM Art Space is here to offer another choice for art lovers.

Here, artists can showcase their work in a friendly and creative environment where people can spend time together—whether as families, friends, or couples.

THM also supports emerging artists, giving them a platform to showcase their work and promoting diverse artistic expression.

The inaugural exhibition at THM Art Space celebrates “Love” through the vision of renowned artist Teayii (Prapatsorn Kanjanasoot), who is famous for creating text art using Thai script.

For this exhibition, Teayii interviewed 15 people who still keep items from their former lovers. She then crafted emotionally resonant text art pieces that reflect the theme of “The Best Way to End”, exploring sentiments surrounding the end of relationships.

Each of these sentimental objects is displayed alongside five additional items contributed by the artist, without indicating which item belongs to whom. Some of the showcased items include:

A tattoo of his name: “I asked her if she wanted to erase this tattoo. She confidently replied that there’s no mark of love she isn’t proud to remember.”

A set of plastic cutlery they once shared: “I won’t forget the dream companion, even though he is now dreaming with someone else.”

This ring: “Even if she sounds tough, I know she’s a courageous soul with a broken heart.”

A dried rose: “I hope the owner of this withered flower sheds no tears when revisiting these memories.”

A watch: "”Please donate this after the exhibition ends. – Moving forward, not waiting any more.”

A film camera, first gift: “She left it here, saying the past doesn’t matter as much as the present.”

The 20 displayed items tell stories of once beautiful memories through the artist’s pen. Visitors are invited to explore the changes and connections that, though they may have ended, have fostered new, positive feelings.

Teayii shared her concept for this exhibition, saying, “This idea stems from a respect for love that has ended, a respect for a moment in time when we felt connected. Sometimes, memories don’t have to be painful.

“Each story in this exhibition is based on real experiences from people around us. Visitors can feel the memories embedded in these objects and find inspiration to move past pain and start anew.”

Sanuphat Sirisao, art director of THM Art Space and Happy Group (1988), collaborated with the artist in designing the 300-square-metre space to reflect the exhibition’s theme and capture the diversity of love experiences.

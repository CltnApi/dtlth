The partnership of three leading Thai brands—PT, Circular, and Yuedpao—introduces the ReWear ReCare collection, a groundbreaking sustainable fashion initiative. This collaboration transforms textile waste into modern lifestyle pieces, creating a circular economy that reduces environmental impact.

The collection features ECOTECH TIMELESS T-shirts and caps, made from recycled fabrics through Circular’s advanced textile recycling technology. Each garment highlights the journey of donated clothes, reimagined into minimalist designs that prioritise comfort and style.

The initiative began with PT’s “ตู้แจกแต้ม” (Point Collection Box) campaign, where PT MAX Card members donated used clothing at participating PT gas stations in exchange for loyalty points. Circular then processed these items into new yarn, weaving them into fresh fabrics while conserving resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Yuedpao added its creative expertise to design versatile, breathable clothing perfect for everyday wear.

The ReWear ReCare collection symbolises the tangible impact of textile recycling, offering high-quality, eco-friendly products with meaningful stories for modern lifestyles.”

Jirarot Pojanavaraphan, Managing Director of Saeng Charoen Grand Co., Ltd., added:“With PTG’s nationwide reach and Circular’s recycling expertise, we’ve created a sustainable collection that represents a leap forward in eco-friendly fashion.”

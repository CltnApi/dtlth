To mark World Children's Day tomorrow, Unicef Thailand will launch "A Better Tomorrow, Today", a public campaign calling for united action towards a safer, healthier and more hopeful future for children. It will run through to Thai Children's Day on Jan 11 next year.

In a world of escalating conflicts, health crises, poverty, inequality and climate-related disasters, Unicef is urging immediate action to uphold children's rights and help every child reach their full potential.

Globally, children are facing a range of complex and interlinked challenges, with 200 million enduring development challenges due to malnutrition and 86 million adolescent girls remaining out of school.

In Thailand, Unicef survey highlights the impact of inequality -- 15% of students don't complete upper secondary school, less than half of grade 2 and 3 children have basic reading skills, and 13% of children grow up stunted due to poor nutrition.

The campaign will include real world creative events bringing the lives of children to life, new films launched online, and a series of "kids takeovers" to shine a spotlight on young people and their crucial role in shaping our future.

The campaign's flagship event will take place tomorrow, when Unicef Thailand will join the worldwide Unicef "Turn Blue" movement. In previous years, world-famous monuments including the Empire State Building in New York, Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Acropolis in Athens and the Dragon Bridge in Da Nang have been illuminated in Unicef blue to inspire nations to support children.

As part of the campaign, Unicef will illuminate Bangkok's iconic Wat Arun, adding this historic landmark to a global hall of fame of celebrated monuments.

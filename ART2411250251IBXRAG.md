ACCESS BANGKOK ART FAIR: ICONSIAM's Global Art Showcase

ICONSIAM, a global landmark on the Chao Phraya River, proudly presents ACCESS BANGKOK ART FAIR, Thailand's first international art fair to seamlessly merge offline and online experiences, enabling collectors to engage from anywhere in the world. Organised by ARTMEETSLIFE (AML) in collaboration with ARTUE from Korea, the fair will take place at The Pinnacle Hall, 8th Floor, ICONSIAM, from 5–7 December 2024.

ACCESS BANGKOK distinguishes itself with the innovative integration of ARTUE’s digital twin and AI-powered tools, creating an immersive Online Viewing Room (OVR) that allows collectors and art enthusiasts worldwide to browse and purchase artworks remotely. Extending beyond the physical event, this digital platform remains accessible after the fair, offering exhibitors the opportunity to connect with a global audience long after the doors at Pinnacle Hall have closed. 

The fair features a carefully curated selection of 30 galleries: 12 from Korea, 9 from Bangkok, and 9 from Southeast Asia and beyond. This diverse lineup reflects the growing international interest in Bangkok’s art market, showcasing a dynamic blend of contemporary talent. Korean galleries take centre stage, with notable participants such as Johyun Gallery and Gallery2—veterans of Art Basel and Frieze—joined by influential spaces like ThisWeekendRoom, A-Lounge Contemporary, Baik Art, and Gallery Soso, renowned for spotlighting Korea’s emerging artists on the global stage. New-generation galleries, including CDA, Objecthood, and FFF, add an experimental edge to the fair. 

From Thailand, nine key galleries, including Nova Contemporary, SAC Gallery, Gallery VER, and Warin Lab Contemporary, demonstrate the country’s rich artistic diversity. Bangkok City Gallery will enhance the experience with an art book lounge, a natural extension of its role as the organiser of Bangkok’s popular art book fair. Internationally acclaimed Tang Contemporary Art, along with regional leaders A+ WORKS of ART (Kuala Lumpur), The Drawing Room (Manila), and Richard Koh Projects (Singapore), further elevate the fair’s regional representation, adding a global dimension to this groundbreaking event. 

ACCESS BANGKOK ART FAIR marks a significant milestone for Bangkok’s art scene, uniting local and international galleries, artists, and collectors in a landmark event. Supported by Thai institutions and leading galleries, ACCESS BANGKOK is poised to cement Bangkok’s reputation as a key destination on the global art stage. 

ACCESS BANGKOK ART FAIR is open to the public from 5–7 December at The Pinnacle Hall, 8th Floor, ICONSIAM, with free entry. Everyone is invited to experience this extraordinary convergence of art, culture, and technology.

Building on Highgate’s nearly 460 years legacy of educational excellence, the Thailand campus will adhere to the core principles of ambitious education, personalised pastoral care, and a rich extracurricular program. The school aims to cultivate a lifelong love of learning, ensuring each student reaches their full potential in a supportive and inclusive environment.  

To ensure the highest standards of teaching, Highgate International School Thailand will recruit a diverse and highly qualified staff, predominantly from the UK. Teachers will be carefully selected by the Highgate UK campus, ensuring they fully understand and adhere to Highgate’s ethos and standards of excellence. This rigorous process guarantees that students receive instruction from educators who are not only experts in their fields but also committed to upholding the high standards of academic and pastoral care for which Highgate is renowned.  

The Thailand campus will feature cutting-edge facilities, including an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a FIFA-standard football pitch, a Golf Academy, a Library and Media Centre as well as purpose-built areas for STEM, Music and the Arts including a state-of-the-art auditorium. The campus has been designed to provide facilities that will support a comprehensive curriculum that promotes both academic and co-curricular development delivering an exceptional student experience.  

This partnership reflects SMG’s commitment to advancing educational excellence and fostering well-rounded development of future generations. By introducing Highgate’s prestigious educational heritage to Thailand, SMG aims to transform the region’s academic landscape and create a lasting positive impact. This collaboration will provide students and families with an exceptional and enriching experience, setting a new standard for quality education in the region.

**Beautiful monsters / Joyman Gallery / Nov 22 to Jan 12, 2025**

The solo exhibition by Thai artist Mr Krang and George, whose real name is Natthapat Dissorn, will combine monsters, body horror, nightmares and dark fantasy into one. He grew up in Surat Thani, surrounded by mountains, dense forests and diverse wildlife. His older relatives told him tales of mystery and local folklore. As an adult, he remains an imaginative listener, especially interested in ghost stories and the supernatural, which inspired him to create his own unique interpretations. In "A Long Folklore", the artist creates a narrative led by Mr Krang and his loyal Thai dog, George. Krang is depicted as a slender man with a mysterious character, dressed in Thai loincloth, constantly facing difficult obstacles due to karmic retribution from previous lives. His loyal companion, George, assists him through various situations, though George himself is actually a former deity who was reincarnated as a human but, due to a mistake, ended up as a dog. The exhibition includes oil paintings, watercolour paintings, and drawings portraying life across realms, acting as a mirror to human society. Natthapat's style is often compared to Kentaro Miura, the late Japanese manga artist behind the dark fantasy series _Berserk_, but that's not such a bad thing. Joyman Gallery is on Maha Chai Road.

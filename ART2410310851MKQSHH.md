Natty’s early career 
---------------------

**"Natty" Anatchaya Suputhipong** was born on May 30, 2002. She is a member of a rising K-pop girl group called **Kiss of Life**.  

**Natty** is a Thai singer based in South Korea. Like many K-pop artists, **Natty** began her career at a young age. In May 2015, she joined a reality show called Sixteen, created by JYP Entertainment. 16 contestants competed to secure a spot in the next K-pop group. They were judged on their singing, dancing, personality and charisma. Unfortunately, **Natty** was eliminated during the final round.

JYP Entertainment is one of the largest entertainment conglomerates in South Korea. It is responsible for producing some of the most famous K-pop artists, including BamBam from Got7.   

Natty's next opportunity came in 2017 with another reality TV show. This time, 40 contestants battled for an opportunity to debut in a 9-member girl group called Fromis 9. Once again she was sadly eliminated.   

Despite disappointments and setbacks, Natty’s determination never wavered and she continued to pursue her dream of becoming a K-pop star. She made her first debut single "Nineteen," a song that reflects her personal experiences as a 19-year-old, released on May 7, 2020, under Swing Entertainment. Her album "Teddy Bear" was released on November 12th, 2020. 

Natty debut in Kiss of Life 
----------------------------

Natty’s effort and determination finally paid off. On May 12, 2023, Natty debuted in the four-member girl group, Kiss of Life under S2 Entertainment. In July of that year, the group debuted with the release of their EP featuring six songs including the hit single "Shuu." 

**Kiss of Life**’s group concert centres around adolescence and young adulthood, resonating deeply with many youthful audiences. According to S2 Entertainment, the name reflects their ambition to "breathe a new life into the music industry with their music and charm." This unique approach has been well-received by fans.

The group’s members include **Natty**, Julie, Belle, and Haneul. **Kiss of Life** recently won their first trophy on the July 9 episode of "The Show". Three candidates were nominated for first place and **Kiss of Life**’s song "**Sticky**" ultimately took the win, marking the group’s first-ever win on a music show. 

The group also won "Rookie of the Year", "Best New Artist" and "Global Rising Artist" from the 31st Hanteo Music Awards. **Kiss of Life** is recognised for their potential as the global lead for the next generation of K-pop. 

Her dynamic rap skills and charismatic stage presence were highlighted in her collaboration with **Jay Park** on "Taxi Blurr," particularly during the group’s live performance on "It's Live."

**Kiss of Life** recently performed at **Waterbomb Festival 2024**, one of the largest water-themed music festivals in South Korea, showcasing their vibrant performance and widespread appeal among audiences.

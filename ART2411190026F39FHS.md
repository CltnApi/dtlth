As Korean heartthrob Jungkook is serving in the military, Disney+ Hotstar will premiere a new three-part docuseries titled The Original on Dec 3, allowing fans to follow his growth from being a member of BTS to becoming an acclaimed solo artist.

The documentary chronicles an eight month period and highlights Jungkook's creative abilities as he travels to New York, London and Seoul to record, perform and film music videos as part of a promotional tour for his first solo album Golden, featuring collaborations with some of the world's biggest producers and artists like Andrew Watt and Circuit, Latto, Jack Harlow, DJ Snake, Ed Sheeran and Shawn Mendes.

The highlight though is the extended theatrical version, which includes around 55 minutes of additional content like performances Still With You, Closer To You and Shot Glass Of Tears at the "Jung Kook Golden Live On Stage" show, interviews with Jungkook's dancers, and behind-the-scenes footage of Jungkook's UK and New York performances.

In addition, fans can also enjoy the eight-part docuseries BTS Monuments: Beyond The Star, which retells the group's first ten years together, and BTS: Permission To Dance On Stage-LA, an exclusive 4K concert film that features BTS' live performance at Sofi Stadium in Los Angeles in Nov 2021.

There is also the documentary Suga: Road To D-Day, which covers BTS member Suga's travels from Seoul to Tokyo and Las Vegas, and other locations in search of musical inspiration for his latest album, D-Day. Meanwhile, J-Hope In The Box, a behind-the-scenes documentary, reveals the process of creating J-Hope's debut solo album. Last but not least, V of BTS, Park Seo-joon of Itaewon Class, Choi Woo-shik of Parasite, Park Hyung-sik of Soundtrack #1 and Peakboy are among celebrities featuring on the travel reality show In The Soop: Friendcation. During a surprise trip, the five buddies participate in a variety of fun activities.

The Poly MGM Museum recently celebrated its grand opening at the MGM Macau, marking a defining moment for Macau's cultural landscape. This collaboration between Poly Culture and MGM signifies a commitment to preserving Chinese heritage while fostering global cultural exchange. The event was attended by notable dignitaries, including Ho Iat Seng, chief executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region; Pansy Ho, chairperson and executive director of MGM China Holdings Limited; and Liu Hualong, chairman of Poly Group Corporation.

The museum is a response to Macau's growing prominence as a centre for cultural tourism, leveraging its historical role as a vital node on the Maritime Silk Road.

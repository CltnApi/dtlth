Mr Thanis Yaovapongaree began his career as a General Manager at CPF before fully committing to the real estate industry. He initially focused on developing rental apartments in Bangkok, including The Grand Mansion, City View, and 20 Boutique in the Lat Krabang and Huai Khwang areas. These projects not only provided steady income but also established a solid foundation for his real estate business, with a combined value of over 3 billion THB in apartment and condominium projects.

"I believe real estate is not just about creating residences; it's about offering quality living spaces and valuable investments for clients," Mr Thanis shared, highlighting the importance of designing functional, compact spaces that enhance everyday convenience.

In 2009, Mr Thanis ventured into condominium development with the Humble Living brand, in partnership with Khun Sangtien Simsiriwong, achieving substantial success. This led to the formation of Triple Co., Ltd. (formerly Triple Land Development Co., Ltd.), which continued to expand real estate projects in the Suthisan and Ladprao areas. Projects such as Humble Living @ Chintavej, Humble Living @ Yuyen, Humble Living @ Supalerk, Humble Living @ Fuengfu, and The Elegant @ Ladprao 1 proved highly popular, selling out quickly. 

While real estate developments in Bangkok were progressing smoothly, the COVID-19 crisis impacted the economy and market in the city. In response, Mr Thanis decided to pause Bangkok projects and instead explore high-potential markets in Phuket. In 2023, he founded Star Beach Property Co., Ltd. to focus on coastal developments for a new customer base. 

**Pier22 @ Bangtao Beach** is Star Beach Property’s debut project, located in the prime area of Bang Tao Beach, Phuket. This low-rise condominium comprises two eight-storey buildings with 146 units, designed to be environmentally friendly and equipped with a full range of amenities, including a swimming pool, fitness centre, and relaxation areas with sea views. 

"Pier22 is not just a condo project; it’s the beginning of a unique living experience in Phuket. I want everyone to feel connected with nature and enjoy something truly distinctive," Mr Thanis remarked, expressing his vision for a residence that balances quality of life with valuable investment potential. 

Throughout his real estate journey, Mr Thanis has remained committed to developing projects that reflect attention to detail and professionalism. From rental apartments in Bangkok to premium condominiums in Phuket, his projects are crafted to offer residents exceptional value and memorable living experiences.

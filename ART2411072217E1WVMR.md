Thailand coach Masatada Ishii has called up 23 players for the two warm-up matches against Lebanon and Laos during the Fifa Day break next week.

Five players have received their first call-ups while some of the biggest names such as Chanathip Songkrasin, Sasalak Haiprakhon, Supachok Sarachat, Supachai Chaided, Jaroensak Wonggorn, Patiwat Khammai and Jonathan Khemdee have been left out.

Sukhothai's Saringkan Promsupa, Uthai Thani's Thitathorn Aksornsri, Khon Kaen's Chitsanupong Choti, Buriram's Seksan Ratree and Prachuap's Panthamitr Praphan are the five newcomers.

"Some of these 23 players will play in the Asean Championship next month. The players that did not make the team have obligations with their clubs next month, so we could not call them up this time and we understand the situation very well.

"But this is also an opportunity for these new players to show their potential and prove that they can become national team players in the future," added Ishii.

Thailand will play Lebanon on Nov 14 and then take on Laos three days later.

Both matches will be played at Thammasat Stadium and will kick off at 7.30pm.

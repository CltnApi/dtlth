Three Korean artists have brought their imagination and unique characters to break the monotony of our daily lives during "Pop Korea: A Korean Group Exhibition In Thailand", which kicks off today and runs until Nov 24, at RCB Photographers' Gallery in River City Bangkok, Charoen Krung 24.

Held in collaboration with 608 Gallery from Korea, the exhibition will help viewers understand some seemingly trivial things, such as why Manwook uses fluorescent colours; why a tree grows from the foot of a robot in the paintings of Park Hyun-woong, aka Emil; or why Yoo Jae-youn's notable character, Kimsee, yearns for "Pink Time".

Manwook explores the relationship between humans and non-human species, expressing various beings through the theme of "Dog-Human-Machine". She emphasises these differences represent diversity rather than discrimination.

In her work, machines are depicted as companions in the system of life. She redefines human identity through a new language that communicates with machines and dogs, co-existing alongside them in a new world as a genderless human within the network.

Artwork by Yoo Jae-youn.

Combining modern sensibilities with retro elements, Emil's work centres around robot stories that blend childhood memories with futuristic imagination.

His latest project depicts the journey of the protagonist "BB", who travels to repair seven robots, set against a backdrop of space travel. His work is both futuristic and emotionally resonant, inviting viewers to project themselves into the world of artwork.

On the other hand, Yoo designs the character Kimsee to represent the everyday person while also challenging the viewer's perception. Her art captures the nuanced emotions of modern life, offering a mirror to the viewer's own experiences.

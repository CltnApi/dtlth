Punthai Coffee Company Limited has unveiled its latest innovation, Punthai Drip Coffee, under the inspiring concept of the “Dripple Effect”. This initiative, led by 10 prominent Thai Coffee Masters, reflects a commitment to sustainability, community well-being, and environmental restoration.

The collection aims to bring the essence of nature to every sip, while fostering economic growth and forest conservation. "Thinking about coffee should come last; thinking about forests should come first," stated Pitak Ratchakitprakarn, President and CEO of PTG Energy Public Company Limited, highlighting Punthai’s mission to harmonise coffee cultivation with environmental stewardship.

**Forest Restoration Through Coffee Cultivation**

In collaboration with Greenovate and local farmers in Chiang Mai’s Pang Hin Fon Subdistrict, PTG launched the Sustainable Development and Promotion Project for Arabica Coffee Cultivation in Highland Areas. This initiative integrates coffee farming with forest rehabilitation, aiming to transform deforested areas into thriving coffee ecosystems.

Since its inception, the project has expanded from 68,000 coffee trees across 200 rai to 420,000 trees spanning 1,400 rai, with the participation of over 400 farmers. Within five years, the goal is to grow coffee on 55,000 rai, benefiting 10,000 households and generating significant income through the purchase of 8,000 tons of raw coffee beans.

Partnerships with organisations like the Mae Fah Luang Foundation, the Royal Forest Department, and the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives further strengthen this mission, enabling sustainable cultivation and fair pricing for farmers.

**A Gift from Nature: The Dripple Effect**

At the heart of Punthai Drip Coffee is a dedication to creating a positive impact. The collection, inspired by 10 Thai Coffee Masters, celebrates the harmonious relationship between humans and nature. Through meticulous planting, harvesting, and production processes, each cup captures the essence of Thailand’s unique coffee flavours while supporting local livelihoods and forest restoration.

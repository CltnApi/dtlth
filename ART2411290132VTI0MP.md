The newly released Guide features 462 establishments – with its first-ever Three Michelin Stars (promoted from Two Michelin Stars), 7 Two Michelin Stars (1 promoted from One Michelin Star), 28 OneMichelin Star (4 new entries, and 1 promoted from Michelin Selected), 156 Bib Gourmand (20 new entries), and 270 Michelin Selected entries (44 new entries). Among the new additions to the Guide, 20 are from Chon Buri (5 Bib Gourmand, and 15 Michelin Selected entries), the newly covered destination in this eighth local edition.

**Gwendal Poullennec**, International Director of The Michelin Guides, commented: “With the country’s first-ever ‘Three Michelin Stars’ restaurant, 2025 marks a significant and historic year for Thailand on the international gastronomic map. What’s more, the entire selection celebrates the richness and diversity of Thai cuisine, and highlights Thailand’s gastronomy as an inclusive market that embraces tradition, modernity, and new trends.”

Thailand’s evolving restaurant landscape and culinary trends as noted by MICHELIN Guide Inspectors.

According to Poullennec, Thailand’s restaurant landscape has seen the continued growth of a new breed of modern Thai restaurants, helmed by young talented Thai chefs – mostly under the age of 35, with international experiences and/or Western culinary education – who start business in their hometown, with a passion to showcase traditional Thai dishes in a modern and sophisticated style, to push contemporary Thai cooking beyond its boundaries.

Moreover, Thailand’s fine-dining scene attracts foreign chefs from all corners of the world, to work, exchange their expertise with local chefs, and train young local teams. The focus on sustainability and local sourcing has also been widely and increasingly seen, with chefs becoming more engaged in sourcing local ingredients and cooperating with small eco-friendly producers. Such momentum inspires local chefs to take the initiative and make their approach with a positive change in the environment.

Michelin Guide Inspectors also found a noticeable number of simple restaurants and small eateries that have passed down recipes from generation to generation, ensuring their authenticity and originality. These types of dining establishments affirm Thailand as a country with exceptionally good food at reasonable prices.

It's being awarded the much-coveted Three Michelin Stars in the 2025 edition is a true mark of excellence, quality, and consistency. Rather than being a detour on the way to a destination, Sorn has now become the destination itself.

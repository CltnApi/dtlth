C.P. Group Alerts Public to Fraudulent Scams

C.P. Group has issued a statement regarding fraudulent activities currently circulating on social media. Scammers are using the name and image of Mr. Dhanin Chearavanont, Senior Chairman of C.P. Group, in fabricated news articles and advertisements that appear to be credible content from reputable media outlets. These deceptive materials are designed to lure the public into participating in fake investment schemes by promising high returns.

The group confirms that these claims are entirely false and have no connection whatsoever to either the organisation or Mr. Chearavanont. The unauthorised use of his name and image is not only misleading but also unlawful, constituting a serious violation of the law.

C.P. Group strongly advises the public to avoid trusting or engaging with any transactions based on these false claims, as doing so may result in significant financial loss or the theft of personal information.

Furthermore, the group urges everyone not to share or forward such misleading messages, as this could contribute to the spread of fake news. Anyone who encounters suspicious content is encouraged to report it immediately to the Cyber Police via hotline 1441.

C.P. Group appreciates your cooperation in safeguarding personal and community safety from these fraudulent activities.

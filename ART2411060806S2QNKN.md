The global diabetes crisis is worsening. With over 537 million people currently living with diabetes worldwide, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) predicts this number to soar to 643 million by 2030. Diabetes is a leading cause of death, claiming 6.7 million lives each year, or one death every 5 seconds. Thailand is no exception, with an estimated 5.3 million people expected to be living with diabetes by 2040. Alarmingly, nearly half of these cases remain undiagnosed. Diabetes not only poses serious health risks, including heart disease and kidney disease, but also imposes a significant economic burden, costing the country 47.596 billion baht annually.

This alarming situation highlights the urgent need for effective solutions, particularly improved access to quality care. Such access is crucial for managing diabetes and preventing complications. Novo Nordisk's Affordability Project represents a significant step forward in addressing this issue and serves as a model for public-private partnerships aimed at raising awareness and improving healthcare access.

**Mr. Enrico Cañal Bruland, Vice President and General Manager, Novo Nordisk Pharma (Thailand) Ltd.,** emphasized the company's century-long commitment to global health, particularly in diabetes, obesity, and other NCDs. Novo Nordisk is dedicated to driving change for better health today and tomorrow through integrated prevention and treatment innovations. In Thailand, Novo Nordisk has initiated the Affordability Project in collaboration with the Department of Medical Services, Ministry of Public Health, to ensure equitable access to quality care for diabetes patients. This project aims to improve diagnostic access and transfer diabetes care expertise to healthcare professionals, leading to more effective diabetes management, reduced complications, and lower healthcare costs."

Mr. Enrico Cañal Bruland, Vice President and General Manager, Novo Nordisk Pharma (Thailand) Ltd.

The Affordability Project is a three-year initiative spanning from 2022 to 2025. To date, it has successfully achieved over 70% of its targets across three key areas.

1.  A total of 53,000 individuals across 13 health zones in 21 provinces have been screened. To date, the project has exceeded its diabetes screening target.
2.  A total of 7,000 healthcare professionals and related personnel involved in diabetes care have been trained, with over 85% of them completing the training program. This training has been conducted in 2,212 hospitals nationwide, and practical workshops have been organized for those seeking to enhance their diabetes management skills.
3.  A total of 7,000 diabetic patients are enrolled in an intensive glucose control program. In the initial phase, 2,500 patients participated and achieved a 70% reduction in their HbA1c levels. Notably, 21.5% of these patients met their individual goals. The program will now expand to include an additional 2,500 patients in the second phase. These results highlight the effectiveness of the program's intensive care approach.

To ensure the long-term success of the Affordability Project, continued collaboration from all sectors and sustained financial support are crucial. Additionally, the development of a robust data system for monitoring and evaluation is essential. The project not only increases the number of individuals screened and treated but also significantly reduces the nation's healthcare costs. Studies have shown that effective blood glucose control reduces the incidence of severe complications such as kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, leading to substantial long-term cost savings.

The Royal Bangkok Symphony Orchestra Foundation presents "Melodies for Medicine: A Celebration of Classical And Thai Music", a special event that combines a medical talk and a concert at Kian Gwan Building, Witthayu Road, on Sunday from 2pm to 4.30pm.

Held with the support of B.Grimm Pharma and the Network of Supporters for Precision Cancer Care, the event aims to raise awareness on the latest advances in cancer care, while simultaneously providing a therapeutic and uplifting experience through music.

The afternoon will feature a medical forum on cutting-edge innovation for cancer prevention and treatment presented by prominent specialists -- Asst Prof Dr Somponnat Sampattavanich, Dr Vigrom Jennetisin and Prof Vip Viprakasit -- at 2pm.

It will be followed by a concert performance that combines classical Western and Thai music performed by esteemed musicians -- Chanyapong Thongsawang (piano), Kimiko Mashima (vocalist), Korawij Devahastin Na Ayudhya (piano) and Andrew Healey (cello), starting at 3pm.

Highlighting the healing power of music in the fight against cancer, the programme features classical works by famous composers who themselves battled cancer, including Rossini, Brahms, Puccini and Rachmaninoff, alongside cherished Thai compositions by Nat Yontararak, Prasit Silpabanleng and Saisuree Chutikul, whose contributions to Thailand's classical music community have been groundbreaking.

Tickets cost 700, 1,000 and 1,500 baht. All proceeds will support the Precision Cancer Care For All under Siriraj Foundation fundraising efforts to promote access to precision diagnostics for cancer patients in need.

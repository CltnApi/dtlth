In 2020 and 2022, Van Cleef & Arpels took home two prizes at the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Genève. This year the maison scored a hat trick.

Firstly, Lady Arpels Jour Enchanté, showcasing traditional and innovative enamelling techniques, won the Artistic Crafts Watch Prize at the GPHG 2024.

The Extraordinary Dials creation presents a hand-sculpted white gold fairy, whose wings feature transparent plique-à-jour enamel. White gold leaves with plique-à-jour enamel and diamonds harbour flowers centred by glowing yellow sapphires.

Creating a façonné enamel flower.

The newly-developed façonné enamel technique lends the blossoms high relief and an illusion of a flowerbed. Poured onto a stainless steel medium, the material is sculpted to produce a three-dimensional bloom. Induced tension is eliminated by low-temperature firing and the enamel is carefully glazed at high temperature. The entire process results in a smooth and luminous surface and a striking visual effect of volume and transparency.

Van Cleef & Arpels also developed a gemsetting technique within the enamel with no other metal components. After positioning each stone in an indentation finely carved in the enamel, re-firing to a precise temperature seals the composition while delivering a "floating" effect.

The time is indicated on the sun sparkling with spessartite garnets, coloured sapphires and diamonds. The sun rays are secured with another innovative lifted setting that makes the stones appear suspended like dewdrops.

The assembly of the extraordinary dial took two years of development and 180 hours of work, earning Van Cleef & Arpels the prestigious Artistic Crafts Watch Prize. The craftsmanship continues on the caseback through an engraved decor illustrating the fairy taking flight.

Enamelling also enhances the aesthetic of Lady Arpels Brise d'Été, which was awarded the Ladies' Complication Watch Prize for its mechanical creativity and complexity.

Two butterflies in plique-à-jour enamel come to life on demand, taking turns to indicate the time at noon and midnight. With a simple press of a button, they fly around the matte mother-of-pearl dial, passing swaying flowers set with spessartite garnets, leaves paved with tsavorite garnets and grass blades in plique-à-jour enamel.

The miniature painting involves applying colours -- a mixture of silica powder, finely ground pigments and oil -- to the plique-à-jour butterflies and vallonné enamel petals.

Each hue in the colour gradient requires its own firing procedure with the precise time and temperature known only to master enamellers.

The casebacks of the Lady Arpels Brise d'Été as well as the Lady Jour Nuit -- the recipient of the Ladies' Watch Prize -- boast an enamel decal on sapphire crystal.

For the latter, Van Cleef & Arpels developed the use of platinum for the fairy silhouette and the pointillism technique to impart a colour gradient on the sapphire crystal.

On the dial, a mother-of-pearl shroud painted in blue and adorned with a guilloché motif symbolises the horizon. A 24-hour rotating disc crafted from Murano aventurine glass shimmers as a blue background for diamond-set stars, diamond-paved moon and yellow gold guilloché sun.

While displaying only the time, the Lady Jour Nuit stands out with a mechanism that reflects the trajectories of the celestial bodies, as an expression of Van Cleef & Arpels' Poetry of Time.

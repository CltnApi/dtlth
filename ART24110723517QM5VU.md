Trafficked antiques to be brought home

Antiques from the 3,000-year-old Ban Chiang World Heritage Site are scheduled to be returned to Thailand next week to mark the International Day against Illicit Trafficking in Cultural Property.

According to the regional office of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) in the Thai capital, the US Embassy in Bangkok will host the ceremony on Nov 14 at the Issaravinitchai Royal Hall inside the Bangkok National Museum.

Robert Godec, the US ambassador, and Rafik Mansour, deputy assistant secretary of the US State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, will hand over the returned artefacts to Culture Minister Sudawan Wangsuphakitkosol, the Unesco office said.

Meanwhile, another ancient artefact is set to be returned to its hometown in Phayao province after 36 years.

Wisut Chainarun, a Pheu Thai Party list-MP, recently revealed that "Phra Jao Tong", a 900-year-old bronze Buddha statue which was stolen from Wat Sri Ping Muang in Wiang Lo sub-district of Chun district in October 1988, has been found.

The statue, which is 128 centimetres tall and 79cm wide, was built in the Lanna style by a local artisan.

Mr Wisut said Phra Jao Tong was smuggled and sold overseas. It was last seen in Switzerland.

As part of a local task force searching for the statue, Mr Wisut, a Phayao native, said a recent operation successfully located it, and it was returned to Thailand in August.

Phra Jao Tong is now installed at the Bangkok National Museum under the surveillance of the Fine Art Department, said Mr Wisut.

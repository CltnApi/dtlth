UTN wants stiffer fraud sentences

The United Thai Nation (UTN) Party will propose amending the law to limit the Corrections Department's ability to push for jail sentence reductions for inmates in public fraud cases.

The party seeks an amendment to Section 343 of the Criminal Code governing public fraud offences. UTN has been spurred into action by The iCon Group scandal in which the firm's executives have been accused of running a pyramid scheme causing hundreds of millions of baht in damages.

The party fears that even if the executives are eventually convicted, they will serve out their jail term in a few years and continue the alleged fraud.

Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana, deputy leader of the UTN, said fraud, as defined by the Criminal Code, is committed via the dissemination of false or concealed information to victims. The offence is punishable by up to five years in jail, a maximum 10,000 baht fine, or both. He said after being convicted, The iCon Group executives will come under the supervision of the Corrections Department, which may apply to have their jail sentences reduced or request parole for them.

The law pertaining to public fraud should be amended to close any loopholes and make punishments stiffer to deter potential cheaters from committing the crime, which costs many victims their life savings and even drives some to commit suicide.

The party's legal team has studied the law and prepared a proposal to be tabled in parliament seeking the amendment, Mr Thanakorn said.

He added that the proposal would be ready for submission to the House of Representatives as soon as the next parliamentary session opens in December.

He said the party must act fast to get amendment approval in time for the indictment of suspects in various fraud cases, including The iCon Group one.

"Although the Corrections Department is authorised to act within its power \[to seek the early release of inmates\] to allow them to redeem themselves, it must give thorough consideration and exercise extra caution to keep inmates from being granted jail term reductions that lead to them being released prematurely.

"It's all in the name of respect for the law and to deter a repeat offence," Mr Thanakorn said.

Deputy premier Phumtham Wechayachai said yesterday that Pheu Thai might take legal action against Palang Pracharath spokesman Pol Lt Gen Piya Tawichai for alleging some party figures were linked to the iCon Group.

The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) is urging both foreign and domestic tourists to take time this cool season to marvel at the light show being offered by the Nasatta Light Festival Winter Illumination in Ratchaburi from today until April 27.

Nasatta Park, a cultural tourism and learning destination, preserves Thai heritage through modern technology. Hosting its first light festival in 2018, the park has continued this annual event, which is now in its 7th year. This year’s theme, “Thai Literary Heroines and Flowers in Literature” showcases Thailand's unique stories and legends.

Covering over 30 rai (12 acres), the park features 24 illuminated zones adorned with millions of lights, creating breathtaking and grander displays than ever.

Yuthalak Siripornlert, executive director of Nasatta and Sirilert Co., told a recent press conference that Nasatta Park came about from the founder’s dedication and expertise in fibreglass art, and has evolved into a hub for preserving Thai cultural heritage.

“The founder’s vision is to conserve Thai heritage for future generations, creating a centre of religious faith, cultural pride, and an educational tourism experience. By integrating modern technology and meaningful activities, Nasatta Park offers an enriching and enjoyable experience for both Thai and international visitors of all ages,” he said.

Wannapa Kiatphongsa, Central Region director of TAT, noted that Nasatta has transformed Ratchaburi from a secondary destination into a must-visit city.

“It has become a magnet for attracting both domestic and international tourists, significantly contributing to the region’s economic growth,” she said.

The TAT is proudly supporting the Nasatta Light Festival Winter Illumination for the 7th year, offering a valuable cultural experience that reflects the unique heritage of Ratchaburi through stunning light displays, Wannapa added.

The festival also features a variety of stalls selling souvenirs, processed products, agricultural goods, and handicrafts from Ratchaburi, aligning with government policies to distribute income across sectors.

Thick smoke billows from the site of the Guanyin statue under construction in Thepha district after the attack yesterday.

SONGKHLA: A 9-year-old girl was among three people injured by two exploding grenades fired into the construction camp of a giant Guanyin statue in Thepha district of this southern province yesterday.

Two more explosions occurred later in the morning on a roadside near the camp.

The first attack occurred at the statue's construction site in Ban Pak Bang Sakom of tambon Sakom about 6.10am.

Somporn Namkheow, 45, from Chaiyaphum province, suffered shrapnel wounds all over his body, while Don Kaewloy, 46, from Kalasin, suffered wounds to her left leg.

The young girl, Manthita Withawet, from Kalasin, had wounds to her head and neck.

All were taken to Thepha Hospital.

The explosions started fires in the workers' camp and destroyed a pickup truck.

At the scene, police found leaflets in Thai and Myanmar languages with messages threatening the lives of people who dared to continue working at the site and elsewhere in the southern border provinces.

A third bomb exploded on a roadside near the camp about 10.30am and a fourth at 10.46am, police said. There were no injuries. Security authorities had already closed the access road.

The explosions startled students and teachers from the Demonstration School of Yala Rajabhat University who had just settled into a two-day scout camp at Pang Yang Resort, about 500 metres away. They immediately decamped, returning to Yala.

Security has been stepped up in Thepha, Chana, Na Thawi and Saba Yoi districts of Songkhla. Bomb experts were scouring the area where the explosions occurred, looking for more explosive devices.

In 2022, Muslims gathered in Thepha district for a peaceful rally against the Guanyin statue project.

The 65-rai seaside area in Thepha belongs to TPI Polene Power Plc. The company is building a 136-metre-high Guanyin statue, which will be the world's tallest when completed.

Currently, the tallest Guanyin statue stands 108 metres high and is on Hainan island in China.

The statue in Thepha district will be a new regional tourism landmark and serve as a viewpoint tower. Work started two years ago and is set to be completed in 2026.

In Chinese Buddhism, Guanyin is female, the bodhisattva of infinite compassion and mercy.

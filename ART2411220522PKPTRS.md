PATTAYA — Two 14-year-old boys received public praise for returning a wallet containing cash and identification documents to police after finding it in an ice bucket outside a shopping mall in Pattaya on Thursday night.

Noppadol Phuphiphat and Phattraraphol Ngao-ngam, both in Matthayom 2 (Grade 7) at Bannernplubwan and Watsuttawas schools respectively, were walking with a friend's older brother when they discovered the wallet outside CentralFestival Pattaya Beach in Bang Lamung district, Chon Buri.

The two teens immediately took it to Pattaya City police station at 11pm, expressing concern for the owner's potential distress.

Pol Capt Anan Mahakitassawakul, deputy investigation chief at the station, said the wallet contained 3,640 baht and 71 yuan, along with identification documents belonging to a Chinese tourist. The police recorded the incident and are waiting for the owner to claim the items.

Witnesses at the station praised the boys for their honesty.

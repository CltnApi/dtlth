The show by Auditoire, divided into four acts, was crafted to highlight Thailand’s rich cultural heritage, tracing its journey from the past to the present and envisioning its future:

It celebrated One Bangkok's location in the heart of a golden land, blending traditional customs with modernity, inspired by the beauty of Thai Lai Rod Nam (gilding).

It drew inspiration from the beauty of the dawn and the vibrancy of the afternoon at One Bangkok, presenting world-class performances seamlessly integrated with One Bangkok's architecture.

The two-day event, scheduled for November 29-30, will feature breathtaking fireworks from five countries: Germany, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Serbia and the United Kingdom.

Over 15,000 fireworks will illuminate the 2.7-kilometre stretch of Pattaya Beach, creating a mesmerising display of light, colour, and sound. The festival will also feature live music performances by renowned artists.

To accommodate the influx of visitors, local authorities have implemented traffic restrictions. Several roads in the area, including Pattaya Beach Road, Central Pattaya Road, and South Pattaya Road, will be closed from 5pm to midnight. Parking will also be restricted in the area.

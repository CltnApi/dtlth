In alignment with the government’s three primary strategies, **Grab** is dedicated to improving the travel experience by introducing **GrabExecutive**, a premium ride-hailing service designed for high-end travellers. Additionally, Grab is committed to promoting lesser-known attractions and hidden gems throughout Thailand by expanding its ride-hailing services to four new provinces: **Ranong**, **Satun**, **Trat**, and **Amnat Charoen**.

Furthermore, Grab will support significant cultural and global events, including the **Ong Ang Water & Colour** for the **Loy Krathong Festival**, as well as prominent music festivals such as **Rolling Loud Thailand** and Wonderfruit. Through these initiatives, Grab aims to position Thailand as a premier global tourism destination.

**Worachat Luxkanalode**, **Country Head of Grab Thailand**, said, “Following our participation in the government-initiated Tourism Taskforce, a collaboration between the public and private sectors aimed at driving Thailand’s tourism industry, we are committed to leveraging our technological expertise and robust ecosystem across Southeast Asia to attract international tourists to Thailand and provide them with seamless travel experiences. We plan to develop and expand our services to meet the diverse needs of foreign visitors, supporting their participation in various activities and events. Additionally, we will collaborate with partners across all sectors, including leading accommodation booking platforms, hotels, and airlines, to enhance Thailand’s tourism industry in alignment with the government’s '**Amazing Thailand Grand Tourism Year 2025**' campaign. This campaign focuses on increasing tourist convenience through digital technology, ensuring safety and accessibility, and promoting sustainable tourism.”

As a member of the **Tourism Taskforce**, Grab is committed to enhancing its services and supporting key events in Thailand via three strategic pillars:

1) Enhancing the travel experience to impress tourists before, during, and after their trips: Grab is committed to maintaining high service standards and ensuring safety. To cater to the diverse needs of tourists, Grab has launched new offerings, including **GrabExecutive**, a premium ride-hailing service. This service features luxury vehicles like the **Mercedes Benz E Class**, the **BMW** Series 5, the **Toyota Vellfire**, and the **Toyota Alphard**, designed for high-end travellers and those with substantial purchasing power. With fares starting at 2,500 baht per trip, GrabExecutive promises a top-tier travel experience and allows bookings in advance from four hours to seven days ahead.

2) Promoting off-the-beaten-path attractions and hidden gems: Grab aims to offer tourists exciting new experiences while helping to distribute income to local communities. In recent moves, Grab has released an English travel guide titled “**Bangkok: Taste, Tour, Treasure**,” featuring curated attractions and eateries in Bangkok, recommended by Grab’s elderly drivers who share their local insights to ensure a memorable experience for international visitors. Furthermore, Grab plans to expand its ride-hailing services to four more tourist cities next year, including **Ranong**, home to the scenic **Phu Khao Ya; Satun**, known for the **Satun National Museum**; Trat, with its unique **Black Beach**; and **Amnat Charoen**, where the **Phra Mongkhon Ming Mueang Buddhist Park** serves as a hidden gem.

3) Supporting cultural and global events: Grab aims to showcase Thailand’s unique and rich culture while establishing the country as a global destination. Under this strategy, Grab plans to provide travel services that allow tourists to conveniently reach the sites of iconic Thai cultural events, such as **Ong Ang Water & Colour** for the **Loy Krathong Festival**, as well as major international music festivals, including the ultimate hip hop music festival **Rolling Loud Thailand** and **Wonderfruit Festival** – a famous gathering of music and arts.

“We are confident that the ‘Amazing Thailand Grand Tourism Year 2025’ campaign will successfully position Thailand as a global destination, stimulate the tourism sector, and strengthen economic sustainability in the country. Grab is committed to supporting the government’s campaign by providing convenient services that prioritize safety and transparent pricing, ensuring every tourist enjoys a seamless and memorable experience,” Worachat concluded.

SAMUT SAKHON: Many people were killed and injured when a launching gantry crane and precast concrete segments collapsed on Rama II Road in Muang district of Samut Kakhon early Friday morning.

The collapse happened on Rama II Road at the construction site of the elevated M82 inter-city motorway’s Ekachai-Ban Phaew section at 4.13am on Friday.

According to initial reports, four construction workers died and ten others were injured.

Samut Sakhon governor Naris Niramaiwong said at the site that the incident occurred when the gantry collapsed.

The governor advised motorists to take detours because of heavy traffic congestion in the vicinity.

“We will speed up clearing the area to resume traffic on Rama II Road quickly,” Mr Naris said.

The expressway lanes of Rama II Road were completely closed and some frontage lanes remained open on both sides of the road.

This collaboration will lead to the application of space and geoinformatics technology in wildlife management for conservation and biodiversity preservation. A notable project, “Bio-Conservation: A Mission for Biodiversity” will soon be launched, focusing on the sustainable reintroduction of the Great Hornbill into its natural habitat.

The **Great Hornbill**, a critically endangered bird species in Thailand, has been bred at **Khao Kheow Open Zoo** in **Sriracha**, Chonburi Province, and is now being released into conservation areas in northern Thailand. GISTDA has developed small GPS tracking devices that are attached to the hornbills before their release, allowing for their monitoring in the wild.

Aligned with BSRC's vision to “shape a sustainable future with premier energy through innovative solutions”, the company is committed to advancing sustainability across all aspects, with a particular focus on environmental stewardship and biodiversity. **The Great Hornbill** symbolizes BSRC's dedication to creating a vibrant natural world and a sustainable future for generations to come.

Virgin Active, a global leader in wellness, has unveiled its transformative new campaign, Leave the Cult, Join the Club, marking a significant shift in how wellness is approached in today’s fast-paced, appearance-driven fitness world. In an exclusive interview, Dean Kowarski, Global CEO of Virgin Active, shared insights into the campaign’s vision, the brand’s unique approach to wellness, and its ambitious expansion plans, particularly in Southeast Asia.

Kowarski explained that the campaign reflects Virgin Active’s commitment to redefining wellness, moving away from unrealistic ideals and superficial messaging often found in the fitness industry. Instead, the brand champions an inclusive, enjoyable, and authentic approach, encouraging members to prioritise genuine well-being over perfection. The initiative aligns with Virgin Active’s long-term vision to position itself as the ultimate social wellness club—focusing on holistic health rather than aesthetics.

Through this campaign, Virgin Active aims to empower individuals to embrace a balanced wellness lifestyle that nurtures both mind and body. By fostering a supportive community, the brand underscores that wellness is an ongoing journey, not a final destination.

**What sets Virgin Active apart in the wellness industry?**

Dean Kowarski: "Virgin Active stands out due to our holistic approach to wellness. Unlike competitors who often prioritise aesthetics or luxury, we focus on balance. Our clubs provide more than just a workout space—they are environments where members can nurture their physical, mental, and social well-being. From expertly crafted group classes to relaxing aqua spa pools and rejuvenating sound bath sessions, our offerings cater to the whole person. This authenticity and approachability set us apart in an industry that can sometimes take itself too seriously."

**What are Virgin Active’s growth plans for Thailand and Southeast Asia?**

Dean Kowarski: "Since our first club in the UK in 1999, we’ve grown to operate over 240 clubs across eight countries, serving more than one million members. Southeast Asia, and Thailand in particular, is a key focus for our expansion. The region’s increasing demand for holistic wellness experiences aligns perfectly with our brand. We are committed to growing our presence here through new clubs and enhanced offerings in existing locations."

**How does Virgin Active adapt to local market preferences?**

Dean Kowarski: "Understanding local needs is essential. In Thailand, for instance, we prioritise community-focused programmes that foster social interaction—a key value here. We also integrate cutting-edge wellness technology to offer personalised experiences, ensuring our members’ needs are met and they remain engaged. Gathering feedback and adapting accordingly are central to our strategy for long-term member retention."

**How does Virgin Active ensure resilience in challenging economic conditions?**

Dean Kowarski: "Resilience is built into Virgin Active’s DNA. We’ve enhanced operational efficiency while maintaining a strong member-first approach. During recent economic challenges, we bolstered our digital presence and introduced flexible membership options to ensure value and accessibility. Additionally, our sustainability practices align with our mission and members’ values, allowing us to navigate uncertainties while staying true to our purpose."

As part of its Leave the Cult, Join the Club campaign, Virgin Active offers a fresh perspective on wellness in Thailand, challenging conventional fitness trends and promoting a more balanced approach. The campaign inspires individuals to embrace wellness as a personal and authentic journey, focusing on feeling well rather than just looking well.

Dean Kowarski highlights Virgin Active’s commitment to expanding in Thailand through activations that foster genuine connections with the local community. The brand’s vision is to create a wellness lifestyle accessible to everyone, celebrating inclusivity and progress. With this bold campaign, Virgin Active continues to disrupt industry norms, creating a global wellness community that prioritises balance, authenticity, and holistic well-being.

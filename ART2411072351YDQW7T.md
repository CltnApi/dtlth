Yokohama dominate 10-man Buriram in 5-0 victory

Bangkok United's Wanchai Jarunongkran celebrates his goal.

Yokohama F Marinos proved too strong for 10-man Buriram United as the Japanese side claimed a 5-0 win at International Yokohama Stadium on Wednesday in the AFC Champions League Elite.

Anderson Lopes scored twice after Kenta Inoue had given the hosts an 11th-minute lead, while a Neil Etheridge own goal in first-half injury time, and a close-range effort from Asahi Uenaka in the 66th minute, completed the win for John Hutchison's side after Sasalak Haiprakhon's 27th-minute red card.

It was the Thunder Castle's second biggest loss in the AFC Champions League competition. Buriram lost to FC Seoul 6-0 in 2016.

"We did well early on until our player got the red card. The incident happened in front of me. We did not argue with the referee because our player made a slow tackle," said Buriram coach Osmar Loss

"After that, we tried to fight but were unlucky during the last part of the first half that we conceded two goals. For the second half, we tried not to concede more goals, but it was difficult because we had only 10 men."

After four games, Buriram are sixth with seven points while Yokohama, who also have seven points, are third with a better goal difference.

Buriram's next game is a Thai League visit to Rayong on Sunday.

Angels fight back

Bangkok United rallied to defeat Hong Kong's Lee Man FC 4-1 in the AFC Champions League Two at Thammasat Stadium on Wednesday night.

The unbeaten Angels stayed on top of Group G with 10 points after their third win in four games.

Lee Man are at the bottom without any point.

Lee Man took the lead in the 41st minute through a goal from Everton Camargo.

Richairo Zivkovic equalised for the Angels in the 67th minute before Wanchai Jarunongkran made it 2-1 six minutes later.

Muhsen Al Ghassani widened the lead in the 78th minute before Zivkovic added the fourth for the team and his second on the night in stoppage time to seal a 4-1 victory.

In the other match of the group, Vietnam's Nam Dinh made an incredible comeback from two goals down to defeat Singapore's Tampines Rovers 3-2.

Nam Dinh are second on eight points while Tampines are third on four.

In today's rapidly advancing digital age, STEM careers- Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics - play a crucial role in driving innovation and shaping the future. These fields are in high demand globally, particularly in rapidly growing areas such as computer science, engineering, data science, and artificial intelligence. STEM graduates have opportunities to work for leading global companies and apply their skills to a wide range of fields, including finance, healthcare, and product development. These careers often come with high compensation, ranging from $90,000 to $190,000 per year.

Mr. Panuwat Lueangrachanee, Managing Director of Crimson Education Thailand, revealed at the 'Launchpad to Success US STEM Exploration' seminar that there has been a continuous increase of over 50% in Thai students' interest in pursuing STEM education. This is due to the wide range of career opportunities available in STEM fields, including software engineering, systems analysis, data science, investor relations, and medical research. With over 10 years of experience and a global network spanning 23 countries, Crimson Education is a world-leading education consultancy. Annually, approximately 200-300 Thai students, 70% from international schools and 30% from Thai schools, seek their services. Crimson has partnerships with leading organizations such as Amazon, PWC, Ferrari, Uber, Dentons, Stripe, and The Economist, providing internship opportunities for high school students. These partnerships have enabled both international and Thai students to secure admissions to world-renowned universities like MIT, Stanford, and Ivy League institutions at rates 4-9 times higher than average.

Historical statistics show that Crimson Education students have collectively received over 6,000 offers from highly competitive universities in the United States and the United Kingdom, including Stanford, MIT, Caltech, Harvard, Columbia, UPenn, Yale, Brown, Cornell, UC Berkeley, Oxford, and Cambridge, as well as other world-class institutions. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our systematic guidance, as our students have achieved acceptance rates 4.5 times higher than average. Moreover, students who start planning their applications four or more years in advance have a nine times greater chance of gaining admission to their target universities. The acceptance rate for Ivy League universities among Crimson students is 24.75%, compared to the general average of 5.2%. Similarly, the acceptance rate for top 10 US universities is 24.55%, compared to the general average of 4.85%. Last year, Thai students received over 250 offers from prestigious universities such as MIT, Cornell, UPenn, Columbia, Stanford, Oxford, and many others.

One prime example of Crimson’s success stories is Palm – Aukkarwit Nakprasert, who graduated from a Thai high school and received multiple acceptance letters from world-renowned universities, including MIT, UPenn, Brown, UCLA, and UCSB. Palm currently holds a Bachelor’s degree in Physics from the University of Pennsylvania and a Master’s degree in Machine Learning and Big Data from Imperial College London. His journey demonstrates that attending a Thai high school is not a barrier if one is well-prepared and has a solid plan. Palm emphasizes that success is not solely dependent on grades, but also on involvement in extracurricular activities, English language proficiency, and a well-rounded preparation that encompasses academics, extracurriculars, and essay writing.

Today, studying at a world-class university is more accessible than ever, as long as you plan and prepare well. Parents should start by carefully considering their financial plan and supporting their child's development in both academics and extracurricular activities. Consulting with an education consultant can streamline the preparation process through personalized academic planning, tailored activity recommendations, and essential skills training for higher education. Investing in children's future through overseas education offers them opportunities to reach their full potential and achieve global success. Moreover, it opens doors to employment opportunities at leading multinational corporations such as Google, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.

Lovers of Japan have one more week to enjoy traditional Japanese sweets and arts during The Wagashi, Japanese Food, Crafts, And Ikebana Festival, which is running at Charoen Nakhon Hall, M floor of Iconsiam, Charoen Nakhon Road, until Nov 26.

Held under the "Newest & Luckiest" concept to mark the sixth anniversary of Siam Takashimaya, a premium Japanese department store located within Iconsiam, the festival is an opportunity to immerse in a variety of wagashi exclusively created for this event by legendary chefs from eight shops located in eight different prefectures in Japan.

They include Ganyudo shop in Shizuoka Prefecture; Shirohei Rouho in Shiga; Hikiami Kogetsudo in Toyama; Aoyagi Seike in Tokyo; Kameya Yoshihiro in Aichi; Saiundo in Shimane; Noshiume Honpo Satoya in Yamagata; and Nagomi no Yoneya in Chiba.

Wagashi are traditional Japanese confectionery which are a vital part of the culture and heritage. Known for their delicate flavours, designs and colours, wagashi sweets are often enjoyed during special occasions, festivals or seasonal celebrations.

Shoppers can also expect to try other delectable delights from famous confectionery brands such as Nishikido from Hiroshima; Koedo Mameya from Saitama; Chacha Koubou from Tokyo; and Barisart from Hokkaido.

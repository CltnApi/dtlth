If you're interested in the blockchain space or an expert, there's a place for you at "New To Web3? Start Here" which will run at Siam Society, Asok Road, on Friday November 8th from noon to 8pm.

Held ahead of "DevCon 7 SEA" from Nov 12-15, a major blockchain developer conference which will attract thousands of experts from around the world to Bangkok, this blockchain event will bring awareness to the positive side of the industry.

It will deliver hands-on, accessible experiences for anyone wanting to improve their digital skills. Powered by advanced security experts Harpie, people will be safe as they move across the blockchain. Interpreters and specialist guides will be on site to make sure you won't get lost.

The team behind this free event has more than 10 cumulative years of experience mentoring and helping others. It will be led by Ornella Vallana from Bankless Academy, Corinna Schlicht and Guilherme Maueler from Regens Unite, and Caolan Walsh from ETH Ireland.

All of them are uniquely positioned to drive this initiative forward and they will bring expertise in community building, education and event planning, ensuring a cohesive and impactful experience.

With Southeast Asia's market for Web3 projected to expand significantly, it's a good timing for this event. The blockchain industry has created 100,000 jobs within a year and employs over 460,000 people globally showing high talent absorption.

The event is not just for learning, it's about connecting with others from around the world to discover what technology can do for you.

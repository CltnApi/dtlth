This November, cinema lovers in Bangkok have the rare opportunity to experience one of the most groundbreaking films in history on the big screen. Breathless (À Bout De Souffle), Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 French crime drama, will be shown in special screenings at House Samyan starting on Nov 29, courtesy of Sawasdee France and Institut Francais. Showings will be exclusively on weekends, offering audiences a chance to immerse in the film's original French dialogue, accompanied by English and Thai subtitles.

A pivotal work of the French New Wave movement, Breathless follows the story of Michel Poiccard, portrayed by the magnetic Jean-Paul Belmondo. A petty thief and fervent admirer of Hollywood icon Humphrey Bogart, Michel's life takes a dangerous turn after he kills a police officer while fleeing in a stolen car. As he hides in Paris, Michel reconnects with Patricia (Jean Seberg), an American journalism student who becomes enthralled by his charm and rebellion. Together, they share moments of passion, philosophical debates and dreams of fleeing to Italy -- until Michel's past catches up with him.

Breathless was Godard's feature-length directorial debut, but its impact was immediate and enduring, establishing Godard as a visionary filmmaker who redefined modern cinema. Alongside other French New Wave masterpieces like François Truffaut's The 400 Blows and Alain Resnais's Hiroshima Mon Amour, Breathless captivated audiences and critics alike, pushing the boundaries of film narrative and visual style. Its innovative use of jump cuts, direct address to the camera, and allusions to American noir marked a dramatic departure from conventional filmmaking techniques, making it a critical and cultural sensation.

The film's original release drew over 2 million viewers in France and won Godard the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 1960 Berlin Film Festival. Over the decades, Breathless has become a cornerstone of film education, celebrated for its stylistic audacity and influence on generations of filmmakers.

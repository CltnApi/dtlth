Early Life
----------

Nadech was born on 17 December 1991 in Khon Kaen province, Thailand. The Thai-Austrian actor was adopted by Yoshio and Sudarat Kugimiya. He completed high school at Khon Kaen International School and graduated with a bachelor's degree in film and cinematography from Rangsit University. Nadech later earned a master's degree.

Before venturing into acting, Nadech started his career in modelling. His first television commercial was for chewing gum at 17. He made his acting debut in the romance series _Ngao Rak Luang Jai_, where he portrayed one of two wealthy cousins vying for love and fortune.

Nadech gained widespread recognition for his role in _Duang Jai Akkanee_ (2010), starring alongside **Urassaya Sperbund (Yaya)**. Their on-screen chemistry won them both Best Rising Actress/Actor awards, and they continued to collaborate on projects such as _Game Rai Game Rak_ (2011).

In 2013, Nadech starred in his first feature film, _Sunset at Chaophraya_, a love story set during wartime. His performance earned him the Best Actor award.

Box Office Success
------------------

In 2017, Nadech starred opposite Urassaya Sperbund in the romantic comedy _Leh Lub Salab Rang_ and in 2018, he played a Royal Thai Navy officer in the series _Likhit Ruk The Crown Princess_. The 2018 film _Nakee 2_ was a box office hit, grossing 441.2 million baht, making it the highest-grossing Thai film of the year.

Nadech’s latest film, _Death Whisperer 2_, a supernatural horror released on 10 October 2024, has become the highest-grossing Thai film of the year. It surpassed the previous record-holder _How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies_, which grossed over 337 million baht. _Death Whisperer 2_ earned an impressive 104.97 million baht during its opening weekend in Bangkok and its surrounding areas, setting a new record for 2024.

Despite his fame, Nadech remains approachable, humble, and down-to-earth. He is frequently seen interacting with fans in public, using public transport, jogging in parks, cycling, and even doing his laundry on the BTS. This led to the popular hashtag _ณเดชน์อยู่ทุกที่_ (Nadech is everywhere).

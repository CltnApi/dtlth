Recently, Huawei Cloud has been named as a global leader in the Omdia Universe: Cloud Container Management & Services, 2024–25. Huawei Cloud has ranked the top cloud provider in the world for its container services in product strategy and execution, showcasing its leadership in cloud native, the software approach of building, deploying, and managing modern applications in cloud computing environments. This outstanding achievement is attributed to Huawei Cloud's extensive experience and strategic investment in Cloud Native 2.0.  

**According to the report, Huawei Cloud offers a comprehensive container service matrix.** 

*   Huawei Cloud has built an industry-leading hybrid multi-cloud converged infrastructure based on Ubiquitous Cloud Native Service (UCS). This infrastructure covers multiple scenarios, including public cloud, multiple clouds, edge clouds, and on-premises deployment, providing strong support for developers and platform engineers.
*   Huawei Cloud offers two serverless container products, Cloud Container Engine (CCE) Autopilot and Cloud Container Instance (CCI), which excel in scalability and startup speed, enabling users to enjoy amazing elasticity and easily handle surges of up to 10 times the normal traffic.
*   In the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) era, cloud native has become a solid foundation for AI compute, and Huawei Cloud CCE Turbo provides users with strong cloud native AI compute based on Ascend compute.
*   Huawei Cloud's continuous contributions in the open-source field have been recognised, including contributing multiple core projects such as KubeEdge, Volcano, and Karmada to Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and continuously providing innovative projects such as Kuasar and Kmesh, demonstrating its extensive influence around the world.

Huawei Cloud has consistently pursued globalisation, investing heavily in global storage and compute capabilities. Today, Huawei Cloud operates 93 availability zones across 33 geographical regions, serving customers in more than 170 countries and regions. As cloud native takes centre stage in digital transformations, Huawei Cloud is expanding its container services globally to empower enterprises to unleash their full digital productivity. The demand for cloud-native computing has skyrocketed, with Huawei Cloud containers boasting an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 70% in the past three years. 

**In Thailand****,** Huawei Cloud is experiencing rapid growth and has established itself as a top partner for digital transformations. A prime example of this success can be seen in Siam Piwat, a leading real estate and retail developer, the owner and operator of Siam Paragon, Siam Center, and Siam Discovery, and a joint venture partner of ICONSIAM, ICS, and Siam Premium Outlets Bangkok, Siam Piwat turned to Huawei Cloud, Huawei's comprehensive cloud computing platform, to power their omnichannel "ONESIAM" application. Huawei Cloud provided them with a wide range of services and tools to build, deploy, and manage their application effectively, such as Cloud Container Engine (CCE), Elastic Cloud Server (ECS), Data Warehouse Service (DWS), etc. Huawei Cloud's scalability played a pivotal role in Siam Piwat's growth and expansion plans. As customer demand increased, the application seamlessly scaled to handle higher volumes of traffic, ensuring a smooth shopping experience. Huawei Cloud's flexible pricing model allowed Siam Piwat to optimise their infrastructure costs. They pay only for the resources they use. Siam Piwat gained valuable insights into customer behaviour, purchasing patterns, and operational performance. These insights empowered them to make data-driven decisions, optimise their supply chain, and improve overall operational efficiency. 

Huawei Cloud will continue to collaborate with global operators to drive innovation in cloud-native technologies and share its successes. This collaboration will accelerate industry transformations like never before, providing new possibilities for a more inclusive, accessible, and resilient digital society.

Krirk University has once again secured its place among Asia’s top 150 universities, ranking 141st overall and 5th in Thailand in the latest QS Asia University Rankings, hosted on November 6, 2024. This achievement, celebrated at the Asia-Pacific Higher Education Summit, held by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) at Macau University of Science and Technology, marks the third consecutive year that Krirk University has reached this elite ranking. The summit, the largest higher education conference in the Asia-Pacific region organised by QS, also showcased the 2025 rankings, highlighting the university’s dedication to academic excellence and innovation.

This year saw record participation, with 984 institutions from 25 countries and regions featured in the rankings—an increase of 127 institutions from the previous year. In the 2025 rankings, five Thai universities secured places in the top 150, listed as follows: Chulalongkorn University, Mahidol University, Chiang Mai University, Thammasat University, and Krirk University.

QS, a globally respected higher education research organisation, is one of the most trusted university ranking bodies worldwide. The QS Asia University Rankings index evaluates over 10 factors, including academic reputation and teaching quality, to reflect the strength of teaching and research at universities. All Thai universities ranked in the top 150 are leading institutions with long histories, supported by research funding from Thailand’s Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research, and Innovation. Among private institutions, Krirk University stands out as the only one to secure a top-tier position in the QS Asia Rankings, placing among the top 150 from over 8,000 universities across Asia for three consecutive years and ranking 5th in Thailand.

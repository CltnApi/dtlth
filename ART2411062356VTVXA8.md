CentralWorld has been transformed into an international Christmas market featuring premium gifts from around the world for the 69th YWCA Diplomatic Charity Bazaar, which kicks off today and runs until Sunday.

The event kickstarts the season of happiness in the heart of the city, inviting everyone to witness the first Christmas tree adorned with beautiful ornaments and enjoy shopping at the grand international gift and goods festival, with proceeds going towards improving the quality of life of children, women and underprivileged groups.

Presented at special prices at more than 200 booths spanning across 1,500mÂ² covering many areas on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd floor are unique cultural and festive items from 47 countries, curated by diplomatic spouses, offering ideal gifts for Christmas and the New Year.

Joining the event for the first time with a promise to bring high-quality premium international goods are the embassies of Cambodia, Cuba, Laos, Romania and the Holy See.

This is an opportunity to shop for rare items like cashmere shawls handmade in Nepal, unique designer bags from Italy, soaps from Portugal, argan oil from Morocco, luxurious skincare from Spain, croissants from France, a whole wheel of Swiss cheese, as well as limited-edition handbags designed by the spouse of the Honorary Consul of Armenia to Thailand.

The highlight is the international food zone at Eden 3 on the 3rd floor, offering a special culinary experience, with popular items like German sausages, pork knuckles, baked goods from the Holy See and fine wines from South Africa and healthy bakery from Holy Bake.

Also participating are food shops by famous personalities. Prepare to indulge in cookies and caramel cornflake from Bignut by Namfon Patcharin, bakery from Only Amy's by Amy Klinpratoom, and pickled salmon by Tae Satawat.

Originally called Christmas Bazaar when it launched in 1953, the annual event was held at various locations before it moved to CentralWorld.

Last year's bazaar raised over 7.5 million baht, which was used to support 66 charitable projects to support healthcare, provide medical equipment and improve educational infrastructure, especially for children and women in rural areas.

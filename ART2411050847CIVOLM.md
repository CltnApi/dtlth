The Art Haus by La Lanta Fine Art invites art lovers to discover the meaning behind marks through an exquisite selection of prints during "Untold Traces" which is running until Nov 10.

The exhibition examines printmaking as a medium by two talented artists and long-time friends -- Kittikong Tilokwattanota and Shin Koyama. As the title suggests, Kittikong's interest in self-inquiry and Shin's remixing of Japanese history and current culture share an emphasis on traces.

As essential as they are to the articulation of our personal and collective identities, traces are often overlooked and dismissed as partial vestiges of what once was. Kittikong and Shin's works bring them out of the periphery, showcasing their rich reservoirs for research, experimentation and storytelling.

Shin draws from Japan's artistic and cultural heritage to create idiosyncratic expressions of contemporary Japanese identity. The playful and provocative arrangements of historical and visual traces that envelop his characters interrogate the role of the artist as a historian.

For Kittikong, printmaking is a practice of turning inwards -- an observation and composition of the traces of the self as they emerge in colours, forms and characters. Viewers of his works encounter the potency of the meeting of introspection and the pursuit of beauty -- a rawness and authenticity that allows the presence of the self to be fully felt.

**The Art Haus is on the 2nd floor of River City Bangkok, Charoen Krung 24, and opens Tuesday to Sunday from 10am to 7pm.**

**Call 083-095-2028.**

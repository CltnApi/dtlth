The fourth edition of the Bangkok Art Biennale has returned, collaboratively organised by Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, The Fine Arts Department, Thailand Convention and Exhibition Bureau, Tourism Authority of Thailand, Thai Beverage Public Company Limited, One Bangkok and others. 

With “Nurture Gaia” as the theme, the biennale showcases artworks by 76 artists from 39 countries across 11 venues in Bangkok. The locations range from ancient sites such as the Temple of the Reclining Buddha (Wat Pho), Temple of Dawn (Wat Arun) to art galleries and more.

Nurture Gaia refers to the maternal figure of Mother Earth, who's a nurturer and giver of life across cultures. In Hinduism, she is Prithvi. In Southeast Asia, she takes on the form of Phra Mae Thorani. The art biennale will also explore contemporary themes such as anthropology, collectivism, ecology, feminism and the politics of time and place. The “Gaia Hypothesis”, proposed by James Lovelock, posits that the Earth functions like a living organism that supports organic and inorganic matter in a self-regulating system. Today, the said system is disturbed by climate change, pandemics, war and environmental destruction caused by humans. Humanity, as an integral part of Earth, is facing critical challenges.

The biennale features a cavalcade of artworks, many of which will be displayed for the first time, including drawings, paintings, sculptures, videos, and installations from established and emerging artists and collectives. Major sculptures by renowned artists Anish Kapoor (UK) and Tony Cragg (UK) will be displayed at One Bangkok as a part of the Biennale, where they will remain permanently. World-renowned performance artist Marina Abramović returned in a different capacity as a member of the BAB advisor committee alongside six other prominent figures in the art world.

Another noteworthy aspect is that its 11 host venues can be divided into two routes, with CentralWorld and Wat Bowonniwetwiharn Ratchaworawiharn (Wat Bowon) being two new additions. If you take the river route, your stops are Wat Arun, Wat Pho, Temple of Iron Fences (Wat Prayoon), Wat Bowon, Museum Siam, National Gallery of Thailand and National Museum Bangkok, Siwamokhaphiman Hall. If you take the city route, your stops are Bangkok Art and Culture Centre, One Bangkok, Queen Sirikit National Convention Center, BAB Box and CentralWorld. All venues are ready to welcome art enthusiasts except for Wat Arun, which will host BAB from Nov 21.

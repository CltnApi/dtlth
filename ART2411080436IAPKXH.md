The World Film Festival of Bangkok 2024 commenced its 16th edition with a spectacular opening ceremony at SF World Cinema, Central World, on Thursday (November 7).

**Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra**, in a recorded address, highlighted the festival's significance: "_**Film is one of the important soft powers. The government wants to push this matter further. Thai movies are not inferior to those made anywhere else in the world. Thai movies that have had the opportunity to be shown abroad all make foreigners fascinated with Thainess. Film festivals are very important tools. They bring people in the film industry together to exchange opinions with each other.**_"

Whether it is supporting the production of Thai films, personnel development in the film industry, and support for film festivals in the country and abroad**_."

She emphasised that these efforts would "**strengthen the country's creative economy**" whilst promoting cultural exchange.

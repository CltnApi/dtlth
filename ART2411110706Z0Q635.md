Adriano Moraes has tried to lure Demetrious Johnson out of retirement for a “fourth dance” after making his long-awaited return to ONE Championship in style.

The Brazilian put 18 months of frustration behind him by submitting Danny Kingad in the second round of their flyweight MMA bout at ONE 169 last weekend in Bangkok.

It was the former champion’s first fight since a May 2023 trilogy title loss to Johnson in Denver, and now he is looking to reclaim the belt, but his old rival has since walked away from the cage.

Johnson hung up his gloves in September, vacating the flyweight MMA title he won from Moraes in August 2022.

“I think if I take this belt, he will be back for our fourth dance,” Moraes told the Bangkok Post backstage at Lumpinee Stadium after his win. “For sure, I think so, he’s not done.”

American former UFC champion Johnson’s final fight proved to be that unanimous decision win against Moraes on home soil, after the had traded knockout victories in Singapore.

“It’s a pleasure to have a rivalry like that, with one of the greats of all time. For me, it’s a dream come true, from where I came from,” Moraes added.

“DJ, I love you man, happy for your retirement. You deserve everything you have. But I’m here if you want our fourth dance.”

The No 1-ranked Moraes’ win over Kingad put him firmly in pole position to fight for the vacant title, but the identity of his next opponent remains to be seen.

“So, I did my homework. I want the fight. I think I’m in the finals for this vacant belt,” Moraes said. “I saw some contenders in the division have their fights coming up, so let’s watch these fights and see who is gonna be the next.

“I hope we’re going to fight for the title for sure. March would be really great.”

Moraes has been in ONE Championship almost since its inception in 2011, having enjoyed two title reigns and xx wins.

But his decorated tenure only added to his frustrations at seeing MMA put on the backburner in the promotion for the last two years while Muay Thai enjoyed the spotlight – though there are promising signs it is returning to the forefront.

“It’s almost 14 years I’ve been here in ONE championship, I think I’m the ‘OG’ over here,” he said. “But nowadays just the belt is not the thing that motivates me any more. 

“I have eight belts in ONE. For sure five rounds for the ONE Championship belt motivates me a lot. But I want to show my skills and show I’m one of the best athletes in the world. 

“Please dont take me out. I’m one of the best flyweights in the world today. I showed that. That’s why I’m here, because I want to be the best. So if they put the title on the line, I’m going to go forward to take it, because I’m one of the best.

“I think in 2025, MMA is going to come back hard in ONE Championship and I’m so happy. A lot of fighters have their fights coming up.

“I’m just praying to God every single day that this company will keep going forward and just get bigger and bigger.”

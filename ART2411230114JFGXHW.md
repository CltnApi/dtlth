The year-end blockbuster event occurs at the iconic **Lumpinee Stadium** on Friday, December 20.

Born and raised in **Samut Prakan**, Panpayak is a former seven-time **Muay Thai World Champion** and a three-time recipient of the "**Fighter of the Year**" award from the **Sports Writers Association of Thailand**. With nearly 300 fights, Panpayak is one of the most experienced and celebrated athletes in "the art of eight limbs."

This will be his second appearance in 2024 after defeating **Silviu Vitez** at **ONE Lumpinee 83** in October.

Nicknamed "**The Angel Warrior**," Panpayak holds a 5-2 record in ONE Championship, with notable wins over Savvas Michael and Daniel Puertas. His only losses have come from close decisions against his long-time rival and reigning **ONE Flyweight Kickboxing** and **Bantamweight Muay Thai World Champion Superlek Kiatmoo9**.

The 28-year-old fan favourite will look to build momentum heading into 2025 by securing a pivotal victory next month.

On the other hand, **Egor Bikrev** quickly established himself as a fighter to watch. The 22-year-old Russian prospect boasts an undefeated record of 7 wins and 1 draw. He made an explosive promotional debut at ONE Lumpinee 86 in November, where his powerful right hand earned him a **TKO** victory over **Gingsanglek Wor Kumchamnarn**.

This upcoming clash represents a significant test for Panpayak, who faces a younger, aggressive opponent eager to make his mark on the global stage. For Egor, a win over a Muay Thai legend like Panpayak would solidify his status as a rising star in the ONE Championship.

As winter approaches, the northern province of Mae Hong Son transforms into a breathtaking spectacle.

The annual blooming of the bua tong, or tree marigold, is a magnificent sight, attracting both domestic and international tourists.

The flowers, known for their vibrant yellow hue, carpet the slopes of Doi Mae U Kho. This stunning natural phenomenon occurs only once a year, typically between November and December. The unique climate and terrain of the region create the perfect conditions for these flowers to flourish.

The festival offers a range of activities, including cultural performances, local handicrafts, and delicious food. Visitors can also enjoy leisurely walks through the flower fields or simply relax and take in the breathtaking scenery.

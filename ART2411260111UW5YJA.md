In a heartfelt speech, with visible emotion, Samuel acknowledged the dedication of the Malaysian Embassy team and the warmth of the Thai people who worked with the Embassy.

"Throughout my time here, I have been fortunate to work with an exceptionally committed and cooperative team at the embassy, which made my tenure both smooth and meaningful. I have also been deeply moved by the resilience, generosity, and kindness of the Thai people, which have left an indelible impression on me," he said.

Reflecting on **Malaysia-Thailand** relations, Samuel noted the remarkable progress made in various areas, including trade, agriculture, food security, border management, tourism, and regional security.

AI, the buzzword du jour, evokes a range of perceptions, from intimidation due to its potential to "steal our jobs", to inspiration from its vast opportunities. In a world where technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace, AI has permeated various aspects of our lives, particularly for Gen Alpha (born around 2010) who grew up with technology as close friends.

Phonlawat Sirajindapirom, a 15-year-old student at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang International Demonstration School (KMIDS), founder of RevisionSuccess, an AI-powered platform which instantly turns classroom content into quizzes and flashcards, believes the real potential of AI lies in the way we use it, especially in education.

"As someone who has grown up with AI, I see it as a tool that empowers us to focus on what truly matters -- creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving -- while automating repetitive or time-consuming tasks," said Phonlawat, whose platform earlier this year secured a full grant of over 100,000 baht from the International Baccalaureate via the Global Youth Action Fund 2024.

"In education, AI doesn't replace teachers or students; rather, it supports them. For example, platforms like RevisionSuccess use AI to create personalised learning experiences, helping students focus on mastering content instead of spending hours preparing study materials. Teachers can also benefit from AI by automating administrative tasks, allowing them to devote more time to engaging students and improving their learning experience."

RevisionSuccess started out with a small team of like-minded students who shared the same vision. RevisionSuccess co-founder Chotiwith Chotiheerunyaskaya, 18, said that the platform's three original co-founders met at a debate competition in April 2023.

"We were dissatisfied with the top learning platforms. Driven by a passion for learning, after noticing gaps and features that we felt could be improved, we sought to create a website that integrated the best aspects of popular apps while also incorporating AI to make studying more manageable and more efficient for ourselves and for other students," reflected Chotiwith.

"However, a project of this ambition required an equally ambitious team. As word spread, other talented students who shared our passion for learning reached out to get involved, helping to bring our vision to life," he said, adding that now the team behind RevisionSuccess is proudly made up of 10 students, most of whom are in secondary level, from eight schools in Thailand.

While there are many revision platforms in the market, Phonlawat believes his has something unique to offer. "Unlike traditional platforms that require students to manually create study material, RevisionSuccess automates this entire process. The platform generates personalised study guides, organises revision notes, and creates customised quizzes based on the student's specific needs and progress. This saves students valuable time, allowing them to focus purely on learning and mastering the material, rather than spending hours on preparation."

For someone with a strong foundation in website development like Phonlawat, getting the platform started was not the hard part. Sustaining it and making sure target users are reached and satisfied, however, is something he says "no textbook can teach".

"When I first started, I thought it was just a coding project, but it turned out to be so much more. For example, RevisionSuccess just received its first registered copyright certificate from the Department of Intellectual Property, which taught me a lot about intellectual property law. Beyond that, I've had to dive into the business side of things, including handling human resources, managing budgets and steering the marketing strategy. These real-world experiences are invaluable and have given me insights that most people my age don't encounter until much later in life," said the 15-year-old founder.

There's also the marketing side of things, and as their target users are tech-savvy teens, creative content is crucial.

"With everyone glued to their phones, social media is a stage, and creators and brands compete for that spotlight. Social media marketing, mainly on Instagram, has been crucial in promoting RevisionSuccess. We've found success with the algorithm in trying to find a balance between showcasing our features alongside trendy, engaging formats as we experimented using a mix of targeted ads as well as making reels that go viral organically," said Chotiwith.

He also noted that the team regularly holds professional development sessions with schools across Thailand, in which team members show teachers and students how the platform works.

While the platform is still young, barely over a year old, it is off to a great start. With the vast potential of AI waiting to be unlocked, the team feels they have a long and exciting way to go.

"AI isn't taking over -- it's giving us the ability to learn more efficiently, adapt faster and be more productive. I think the key for our generation is to see AI not as a threat, but as a tool that, when used responsibly, can unlock new opportunities in education and beyond," concluded Phonlawat.

The celebrity pygmy hippo **Moo Deng** was given a special mixed fruit platter on Friday as a reward after she “predicted” that Donald Trump would win the US presidential election.

Khao Kheow Open Zoo director Narongwit Chodchoy presented the fruit to the little hippo.

[The prediction](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2896463/moo-deng-predicts-trump-win) was made on Monday when Moo Deng’s caretaker at the zoo in Chon Buri set out two pumpkin halves, each filled with pieces of dragon fruit, apples and carrots.

One pumpkin had the name of Donald Trump carved in Thai on a watermelon rind, and the other that of Kamala Harris. The almost 4-month-old calf ate the one with the name of the Republican candidate. Her mother, Jona, ate the other one.

The video of the event was posted on the Kha Moo & the Gang Facebook page and TikTok and rapidly went viral. International media also picked up the story.

Meanwhile, Khon Kaen Zoo has held a 7-month birthday celebration for Moo Duang, one of Moo Deng’s relatives and a new crowd favourite.

Zoo director Thipawadee Kittikun presented a special gift: a large Jacuzzi tub and rain shower for Moo Duang and his mother, Yaya, to relax in.

They also prepared a feast, including napier grass, bok choy, carrots, pumpkins, and dragon fruit, to spell “Moo Duang”.

Ms Thipawadee said Moo Duang, also known as Duang Ma Phrao, is very popular with tourists, especially children who follow the hippo on social media and come with their families to see him at the zoo.

Since his birth to Yaya and father Nadech, Moo Duang has grown significantly, prompting the zoo to adjust the exhibit equipment to suit his needs.

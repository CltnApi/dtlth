Online game 'rapist' arrested

Online game 'rapist' arrested

Samut Songkhram: A man has been arrested in the province on suspicion of sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl, police said.

Surapol Suanguen, 28, was tracked down Thursday after a warrant was issued for his arrest on a rape charge. According to police, the suspect confessed to the charge. He said he met the victim via an online game and coerced her into becoming his girlfriend.

He then threatened to harm her and her family before going to her home and raping her, police said. The girl reportedly sought help a few days later after he threatened to release a video of them having sex if she refused to sleep with him again.

In another case, a 25-year-old woman was arrested in Bangkok and charged with human trafficking during a sting operation. The suspect, Orn-ouma Akejeen, was nabbed at a hotel room meeting point, where she was found with three girls aged 14, 15, and 16.

Popular pygmy hippopotamus Moo Deng is hogging the limelight at the 29th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan from November 11-22.

Visitors are flocking to the conference’s Thailand Pavilion for selfies and souvenirs at a display inspired by the baby hippo from Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Chonburi province, the Natural Resources and Environment Ministry reported on Sunday.

Apart from Moo Deng-related activities, the pavilion also showcases Thai technology and innovation for greenhouse gas reduction and CO2 storage, as well as climate-awareness seminars held by public and private organisations.

The public can follow events at the Thailand Pavilion via the [Department of Climate Change and Environment](https://www.facebook.com/dcceth/)’s Facebook page.

The pavilion will showcase Thailand’s progress in climate change adaptation, covering policy, technology, action and finance, said Natural Resources and Environment Minister Chalermchai Sri-on.

Chalermchai said COP29 offered Thailand a global platform to explain the country’s role in combating climate change and its effects.

He said Thailand was on course to reach its goals of carbon neutrality and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and 2065, respectively.

Thailand has signed up to the goals under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement.

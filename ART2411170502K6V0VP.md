Commerce Minister Pichai Naripthaphan said that he had held discussions with a senior Walmart official on increasing the presence of Thai products in their stores.

Pichai met Andrea Albright, Walmert’s executive vice president for merchandise sourcing, on Friday (November 15) in Lima, Peru during the APEC Summit.

Pichai said the discussions focused on increasing the presence of Thai products in Walmart stores. Walmart emphasised the importance of traceability and transparency about the raw materials used in product manufacturing, he said.

Global purchasing trends have shifted, with greater emphasis on quality verification, particularly compliance with carbon-free standards. This aligns with Walmart’s policy to reduce the environmental impact by utilising renewable energy, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and enhancing resource efficiency, Pichai said.

"Walmart encouraged Thailand to produce goods that meet these criteria, to have an opportunity for more Thai products to be sold in its stores. The representatives expressed considerable interest in Thai products due to their high quality. This creates a potential export channel for Thai manufacturers who focus on producing goods that align with global trends," Pichai said.

Walmart, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, USA, is the world’s largest retail company. Founded in 1962 by Sam Walton, it aims to provide quality products at low prices. Walmart offers a wide range of products, including food, clothing, electronics, cosmetics, toys and more, through traditional retail stores and online platforms.

Currently, Walmart operates over 10,000 stores worldwide in countries such as the United States, Mexico, Canada, China, India, and Brazil. With over 2 million employees globally, Walmart ranks as one of the world’s largest employers.

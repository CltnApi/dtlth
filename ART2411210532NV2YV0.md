Stadium eyed as gig venue

The Ministry of Tourism and Sports plans to turn the Supachalasai National Stadium on Rama I Road into a new concert venue.

Minister Sorawong Thienthong said yesterday the Department of Physical Education's contract to use the national stadium is about to end. It will return the facility to the land owner which is Chulalongkorn University.

The minister will act as a mediator to negotiate with the university to allow the private sector to lease the indoor stadium to stage concerts.

"The discussion process has begun, so Thailand will have a venue to support concerts or major games," he said.

The land where the stadium is located used to be occupied by Pathumwan Palace.

Work on the stadium began in 1937 and was completed in 1941.

The stadium is 72 metres wide and 110m long featuring an eight-lane running track and a seating capacity of 19,615, four athlete rooms, a referee room, a press room, a VIP reception room, a nurse's room, and a press conference room.

In the past, Supachalasai Stadium has hosted national sporting competitions and concerts, including Michael Jackson's Dangerous World Tour Concert in 1993 and the Blackpink World Tour in 2023.

The Ministry of Tourism and Sports also has a development plan for Rajamangala National Stadium on Ramkhamhaeng Road in Bang Kapi district.

The facility is overseen by the Sports Authority of Thailand, said Mr Sorawong.

"We are discussing whether to continue to take care of it or whether to make it a concession or a joint investment project between the government and the private sector," he said.

The structure is in a state of disrepair and needs funding for renovation work.

However, it might not be worth repairing. If the private sector is allowed to operate the stadium, there are many parties interested in renovating the facility, he said.

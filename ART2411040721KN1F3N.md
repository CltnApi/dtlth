Lyn Around, one of the top five brands under the Jaspal Group banner, has become a key influence in young women’s lifestyle and fashion choices thanks to its “Lyn Around Everywhere” campaign. The impact this campaign has had on the Thai fashion scene was recently recognised with the “Best Fashion Influencer Campaign Award” handed out at the Thailand Influencer Awards 2024.

The award acknowledges brand communication campaigns that stand out in terms of creating a vibrant community for women who share the same interests in fashion and lifestyle. The campaign’s aim is to encourage women to connect, inspire and explore fashion and lifestyle trends together.

**Suvita Singhsachathet, General Manager of Lyn Around at Jaspal Public Company Limited (Jaspal Group),** said the “Lyn Around Everywhere” campaign aims to boost awareness for Lyn Around – a name that has been a fixture in the Thai fashion scene for more than 13 years. The campaign also strategically leverages influencer marketing online as well as on-ground events to maintain the brand’s “top of mind” position both locally and outside Thailand.  

“Lyn Around’s challenge is to bridge the gap with its customers – ‘Lyn Around Girls’ – which had widened during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the three or four years of the pandemic’s fallout, the relationship had weakened, with interactions shifting online,” Suvita explained. “Hence, our goal is to ‘Reconnect and Reinforce’ our band with the Lyn Around community through a sustained, meaningful campaign.”  

Lyn Around is one of Jaspal Group’s top five brands in terms of sales. The brand’s aim is to fire up women’s fashion sense and let them have fun dressing up and standing out with Lyn Around’s “Playful & Quirky” collections.  

The “Lyn Around Everywhere” campaign took the brand offline, connecting with people at events across Bangkok and beyond to launch each new collection, including the “Summer Night Out” event when the 2023 summer collection was launched, the “Dear Myself” event to launch the 2023 spring collection, and “Winter Wonderlust” for the 2023 winter collection. Lyn Around also held the “Beachside Blast” event to unveil its 2024 spring collection.  

At each event, Lyn Around fashionistas were invited to join interactive activities like DIY crafts, themed Polaroid photo sessions and exclusive previews of the latest collections. These gatherings allowed Lyn Around fans to connect with one another, as well as with the brand’s designers and stylists, not to mention a chance to party with people who share the same tastes in fashion and lifestyle.  

At the same time, the brand also harnessed the power of influencers to bring the Lyn Around aesthetic to a wider audience. The campaign focused on fashion, beauty and lifestyle influencers ranging from Macro, Micro and Nano tiers across Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. Lyn Around encouraged fans to share their own looks via the hashtag #LynAroundEverywhere, sparking new fashion ideas and building a network of inspiration through “co-creation” and “brand engagement” activities. This digital initiative generated more than 2.5 million impressions and reached more than a million people.  

Beyond the numbers, the “Lyn Around Everywhere” campaign has also helped build a socially conscious fashion community, offering women a platform to express their unique style, boost confidence and connect through shared fashion interests. Influencers participating in the campaign also inspire their followers to explore personal style and use fashion as a tool of self-expression. The campaign’s aim is to promote the importance of using fashion as a communication tool, through activities and discussions.  

In addition to its online presence, Lyn Around has 38 stores across the country, providing a seamless connection to ensure that customers enjoy the brand’s creative energy wherever they are.  

“The ‘Lyn Around Everywhere’ campaign aims to create a community of women who are passionate about fashion and lifestyle – connecting the brand and the ‘Lyn Around girls’ together.  

“The ‘Lyn Around Everywhere’ campaign aims to create a community and connect ‘Lyn Around Girls’ who are passionate about fashion and their lifestyle. This was possible by leveraging online and on-ground strategies by creating a perfect platform for women to meet, discuss, share and celebrate style and trends,” Suvita said. “It’s a campaign we are proud of, and its success was affirmed by the ‘Best Fashion Influencer Campaign Award’ at the ‘Thailand Influencer Awards 2024.”

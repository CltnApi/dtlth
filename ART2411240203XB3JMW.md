**MAPIM** president **Mohd Azmi Abdul Hamid** said the **Malaysia-Thailand** border area has great potential in the tourism and agriculture sectors.

"We want the socio-economic development in this border area to continue to grow so that it can benefit the local people of both countries. **Thailand** has a thriving tourism industry, while Malaysia has expertise in the fields of animal husbandry and halal food.

"Therefore, **Malaysian-Thai NGOs** and entrepreneurs need to always share knowledge and expertise for the common good," he told reporters here on Saturday.

Earlier, Mohd Azmi had attended a seminar titled "**The Role of the Thai-Malaysian Border Civil Society in Developing the Village Economy**‚Äù, which was attended by more than 100 participants from Malaysia and Thailand.

He said the seminar aimed to provide a platform for entrepreneurs and NGOs from both countries to meet and draw up economic development project plans in the border area.

Mohd Azmi also hopes that a project resulting from the collaboration of entrepreneurs from both countries will be launched in the border area next year.

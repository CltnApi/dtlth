NONG BUA LAM PHU - The 58-year-old **gunman** who shot three people to death in this northeastern province surrendered to police on Thursday, a day after the killings.

Samart Thipakbanjot walked down from Phu Krachom mountain in Na Klang district to turn himself in to police late Thursday morning. He was brought to the Sri Bun Ruang police station for interrogation.

The suspect surrendered after expressing regret for the crime, said Pol Maj Gen Netipong Thatthamlay, deputy commissioner of the Provincial Police Region 4, addressing a press conference at the police station.

After the killings on Wednesday, Mr Samart hid on the mountain overnight before decided to turn himself in late Thursday morning, said Pol Maj Gen Netipong said.

Police were relieved by the decision because everyone on the search team had been warned that the escaping gunman still had his weapon and ammunition, he said.

He also said that financial issues and personal conflicts were the motive for the killings.

At 6am on Wednesday, Mr Samart [killed](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2909690) Preecha Piamai, 54, and his daughter Wachinee, 28, at their house in Ban Takhian Thong village in Sri Bun Ruang district. It was reported that Mr Samart was a creditor of Preecha and held the latterâ€™s ATM card.

Preecha had complained earlier to police that Mr Samart had stolen his 10,000-baht [handout](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2872026) recently transferred from the government. Police had called them in for mediation talks at the Sri Bun Ruang station at 10am on Wednesday but the shootings happened first.

Shortly after the first two killings, Mr Samart shot dead Thaworn Waetthaisong, 68, who was sweeping a road near the Ban Fai Hin intersection. The shooting was captured on CCTV.

It was reported that the victim, a village defence volunteer, had earlier arrested the gunman for theft.

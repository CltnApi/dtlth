Explore the possibilities of a futuristic and tech-driven Thailand with Tomorrow And I on Netflix. This upcoming Thai anthology drama features four distinct episodes, each exploring pressing issues that stretch the imagination.

For over three years, director Paween Purijitpanya, renowned for his sci-fi work, and his production team have meticulously crafted Tomorrow And I. The series aims to challenge viewers' perspectives on Thai society, morality and beliefs in the face of technological advancements.

Paween and his fellow creators have engaged in numerous discussions about the advancement of technology and some conceptual beliefs in Thai society. These conversations inspired them to combine two topics and explore issues such as cloning, prostitution, global warming and Buddhism.

"These are all topics that intrigue us, and we want to pose questions to society about their co-existence with technology in the future. Our goal is to invite viewers to question these concepts. This is the challenge we set for ourselves," Paween said.

The series employs challenging filming techniques, requiring meticulous attention to detail at every step to achieve the intended futuristic vision. On preparing for the production, Paween said: "It was challenging because everything had to be newly created -- the appearance of the city, clothing, technology and the shape of various devices. Some things were adapted from existing items, while others had to be 3D printed."

Paween added that each episode had its own level of difficulty and intricate details, which might not be immediately noticeable to the audience but were essential for building a realistic world. These elements helped actors understand their characters better, allowing for more authentic portrayals.

Tomorrow And I features a talented cast, including Violette Wautier, Ray Macdonald and Pakorn Chatborrirak.

**Tomorrow And I is streamed on Netflix from Dec 4.**

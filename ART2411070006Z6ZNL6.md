In the heart of Thailand's northeastern province of Khon Kaen lies a district often overlooked by many -- Si Chomphu. While Khon Kaen is a bustling centre of commerce, the remote Si Chomphu district remains largely untouched, with its roads and infrastructure seemingly frozen in time. But beneath this veil of underdevelopment lies a treasure trove of natural wonders, and a community that's beginning to realise just how precious their surroundings truly are.

Thanaphon Mahuema, a young boy who left school at the age of 12, is one of those people. His parents, struggling to make ends meet as sugarcane farmers, moved to Bangkok to work as construction workers, bringing Thanaphon along with them. Life in the big city was far from glamorous for the young boy. Stuck in a cramped room, surrounded by concrete and steel, he longed for the lush woods and rolling hills of his hometown.

After three long years, Thanaphon finally returned to Si Chomphu, where he moved in with his aunt, finding solace in the familiar embrace of nature. But his return wasn't just about reconnecting with his roots. It also marked the beginning of his involvement in a movement that would inspire the next generation of environmental stewards in Si Chomphu.

In 2023, Unicef reported that Khon Kaen is one of the 10 provinces in Thailand where children are most affected by climate change. The risks are real -- droughts, heatwaves, floods -- and they disproportionately affect the youngest and most vulnerable.

To amplify children's voices in the climate conversation, Unicef recently launched the #CountMeIn campaign. The initiative encourages young people to speak up about their concerns and ideas for addressing climate change, ensuring that their voices are not lost in the broader dialogue.

Fifty primary and secondary school students gathered to participate in an Environmental Awareness initiative organised by Unicef and Sanya Makarin.

Waraporn Raksaphram, a programme officer for Environment and Climate Action at Unicef Thailand, emphasises that the first step in combating climate challenges is fostering a deep connection between children and the environment.

"When children are aware of the nature and environment around them and understand its benefits, this creates a foundation for them to protect it," she says.

Returning to his homeland, Thanaphon joined an eco-tourism initiative established by Sanya Makarin, a passionate teacher who had also recently returned to Si Chomphu after years of working in the city. Sanya was disheartened by the lack of pride among locals for their hometown, despite its natural beauty. Determined to change this, he launched an eco-tourism initiative that would not only introduce the district's hidden gems to the world but also instil a sense of pride and responsibility in the community, especially among its children.

"I loved the woods since I was young and I love it even more now," says Thanaphon, who joined Sanya's initiative as a volunteer. He began exploring every nook and cranny of the district, from the towering mountains to the serene streams and ancient cliff paintings. The more he learned, the deeper his appreciation for Si Chomphu's natural beauty grew. Now, whenever he sees someone cutting down trees, he doesn't hesitate to report it to the authorities. "I want to protect the woods."

Thanaphon's story is a testament to the power of nature appreciation and environmental education in shaping the minds and hearts of young people. But it's not just about learning to love the outdoors; it's about understanding the profound impact that climate change can have on their lives and communities.

Chulalak Wantanee, a 10th grader at Si Chomphu School, is deeply concerned about a proposed mine that threatens to destroy the district's mountains and pollute its environment.

In Si Chomphu, this call to action is being embraced with enthusiasm. On a recent Saturday, 50 primary and secondary school students gathered to participate in an Environmental Awareness initiative organised by Unicef and Sanya. Together with an environment influencer Jareerat "Baitong" Petsom who joined the visit, the children spent the day exploring the district's natural treasures -- climbing cliffs, wading through streams, and marvelling at waterfalls. The next day, they teamed up with university students who volunteer through the "I Am UNICEF" programme to learn storytelling and media creating skills.

Through photo stories and videos, the children shared their experiences and expressed their desire to protect their community's natural resources.

One of these young voices is Chulalak Wantanee, a 10th grader at Si Chomphu School. She is deeply concerned about a proposed mine that threatens to destroy the district's mountains and pollute its environment.

"If it happens, the mountains will be gone," she says. "It will create pollution and affect our health and ways of living. I want to protect our mountains."

The weekend culminated in a joyful showcase of the children's videos, presented to community leaders who gathered to listen to their ideas and concerns. For many, it was the first time they had the opportunity to speak directly to adults in charge about the future of their community.

"This is the first time we actually got to sit down with community leaders to share our vision of the community." says Sanya.

As for Thanaphon, his love for nature continues to grow. He dreams of becoming a forest protection officer at the local national park, dedicating his life to safeguarding the very woods that brought him back to Si Chomphu.

"Although my district Si Chomphu means pink, it's actually green," he says with a smile. "And I want to keep it green."

Boghossian’s High Jewellery Tribute to Bangkok’s Grand Palace

Renowned Swiss jeweller Boghossian has chosen Bangkok for the debut of its “Palace Voyages” high jewellery collection in Thailand. From 11 to 13 November 2024, the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok will host a Luncheon and Private Showcase, unveiling 13 exquisite pieces that capture the enchanting spirit of some of the world’s most celebrated palaces, including Thailand’s Grand Palace, Beijing’s Qianlong Palace, and England’s Brighton Pavilion. 

Highlighting this collection are the “Grand Court” sets, designed in homage to Bangkok’s iconic Grand Palace, a historic masterpiece constructed in 1782. Once home to the Kings of Siam, the Grand Palace’s spectacular architecture, traditional gold leaf tiles, and intricate glasswork serve as a wellspring of inspiration for Boghossian’s artisans. 

The “Shimmering Rays” ensemble, a standout of the collection, mirrors the palace’s radiant glow with an array of fancy intense yellow and white diamonds. The design employs an invisible setting technique, creating pure, uninterrupted lines that evoke the soaring columns and majestic architecture of the Grand Palace. At its centre, a pendant reimagines the mythical Naga, a dragon-like figure seen throughout the palace’s design, adding a mystical element to this contemporary jewellery piece. 

Another highlight, the “Golden Dragon” set, captures the palace’s regal roof through polished gold and diamond accents. This set draws from the Naga-adorned pedestals of the palace’s columns, with intricate diamond settings that blend kite, trapezoid, and square cuts into an elegant bracelet, designed as a base from which the arm rises gracefully. 

Albert Boghossian, CEO of Boghossian, shared, “It is our immense honour to bring our ‘Palace Voyages’ collection to one of the cities that inspired it. Like a jewel itself, a palace distils the essence of fantasy and beauty. With the ‘Grand Court’ sets, we hope to keep alive the artistry and craftsmanship symbolised by Bangkok’s Grand Palace, celebrating mankind’s cultural legacy.” 

The “Palace Voyages” collection continues to pay tribute to history, culture, and unparalleled craftsmanship, bridging East and West in a dazzling showcase that transports wearers to the grandest courts of the past.

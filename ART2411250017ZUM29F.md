The characters CryBunny and CryTeddy by world-renowned artist Molly are showcased at Siam Paragon and Siam Center for the first time, until Sunday.

Presented by Molly Factory Studio, the exclusive event will take fans into an emotional journey of healing through Molly's creative vision with beloved original character CryTeddy making their giant-sized debut for the first time.

Molly or Nisa "Mod" Srikamdee is a world-renowned Thai artist whose art toys have been the hottest collectables of the year.

The "Siam Paragon x CryBunny 'Letting Go'" is running at Parc Paragon of Siam Paragon and "Siam Center x CryTeddy 'Holding On'" is on the ground floor of Siam Center.

The "Letting Go" concept represents the act of breaking free from the chains of past struggles and tickets to this space are 290 baht, available on ticketmelon.com, while the "Holding On" concept suggests that it's time to walk away from troubles.

These inflatable characters embody the sensation of letting go, evoking feelings of lightness and relief, ultimately reminding us that life is about letting go of attachments and embracing only what truly matters.

The event also features CryBunny and CryTeddy pop-up stores offering character-themed merchandise, limited edition art toys only available at the event, as well as interactive activities.

There are 12 sessions per day, each lasting 45 minutes for 45 participants to enter the pop-up store, daily from 11am to 8pm. Registration for slots is available via ticketmelon.com.

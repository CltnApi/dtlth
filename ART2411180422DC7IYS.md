**Thailand Space Week 2024 (TSW2024)**, Southeast Asia’s premier space technology and innovation event, concluded with record-breaking success on 9 November 2024 at Impact Muang Thong Thani. Drawing over 4,500 attendees, the three-day event solidified Thailand’s aspirations to establish itself as a strategic space hub in the region.

Organised by the **Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA)** under the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (MHESI), TSW2024 featured collaboration with over 70 leading organisations, including Japan’s Cabinet Office, ISPACE, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, PTT Public Company Limited, Siemens, and Thaicom. The event showcased cutting-edge space technology across 100 exhibition booths. 

The Thai government recognises the economic and technological potential of the space industry and has prioritised initiatives like TSW2024 to foster innovation, create networking opportunities, and support sustainable growth. The event aimed to bridge academia, the private sector, and the public, with activities ranging from plenary sessions led by global experts to hands-on workshops designed for entrepreneurs, students, and enthusiasts. 

With this year’s theme, **“Converging Technologies, Connecting People,”** TSW2024 highlighted the practical applications of space technology, including satellite-based solutions for flood, fire, and haze monitoring. Interactive sessions inspired Thai youth, encouraging them to explore careers in space technology and connect with agencies offering mentorship and educational support. 

The event was a unique platform for domestic and international stakeholders to share knowledge, foster partnerships, and explore collaborative opportunities. By connecting innovation with economic value, TSW2024 showcased how space technology can drive progress towards Thailand’s goal of becoming a regional leader in the industry. 

As the curtains close on **Thailand Space Week 2024**, anticipation builds for next year’s event, which promises to continue uniting and inspiring the regional space community.

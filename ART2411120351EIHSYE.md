KYODO — Former Japan striker Kazuyoshi Miura said Monday he plans to continue playing for Atletico Suzuka in the Japan Football League (JFL) next year in what will be his 40th season as a professional.

The player known to fans as "King Kazu" or simply Kazu turns 58 next February and will extend his record as the oldest player to appear in the JFL, the fourth tier of Japanese football.

Miura joined Suzuka on loan from J-League second-division club Yokohama Football Club (FC) in June this year following a stint with Portuguese second-tier side Oliveirense.

The Shizuoka Prefecture native left Japan at 15 for Brazil, where he made his professional debut with Santos in 1986. After returning to Japan in 1990, Miura won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in the J-League's inaugural season in 1993 while at Verdy Kawasaki, now Tokyo Verdy.

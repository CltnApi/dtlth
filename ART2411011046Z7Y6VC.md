Robinson Lifestyle, under Central Retail, announces 2.5 Billion Baht Investment to Transform Shopping Center and Expand New Branches, Enhancing Experiences for Customers, Partners, and Communities 

Robinson Lifestyle has announced a proactive initiative to enhance customer experiences and cater to diverse lifestyles. The company plans to transform its shopping centers across Thailand into comprehensive lifestyle hubs, guided by its “Lifestyle and Experiential Community” strategy, to meet the needs of all customer segments. This approach positions Robinson Lifestyle as a Complete Lifestyle Destination, offering a variety of destinations, such as Dining, Family, Sport, Pet, and Tourist, while bolstering Thailand’s economy and supporting sustainable growth. 

Mr. Lertvit Pumipitak, President of Robinson Lifestyle under Central Retail, expressed the company’s dedication to transforming its shopping centers into vibrant community hubs, aiming to become customers’ top destination of choice. In response to evolving global lifestyle trends, the company is investing over 2.5 billion baht in a major renovation initiative. This project includes upgrades to branches in Kanchanaburi and Samut Prakan, as well as the opening of two new locations, all slated for completion within two years. Each site’s design is inspired by the distinctive cultural heritage of its location, modernised to offer a contemporary aesthetic while delivering immersive lifestyle experiences that encourage customers to enjoy a full day at the center. 

To deliver a comprehensive experience that meets all customer needs, the pilot branches will be developed as large mixed-use projects encompassing various dimensions. These will include a shopping center, a semi-outdoor mall, a commercial strip mall, and a hotel. Key features include:

One of the key factors contributing to the success of a shopping center is its "partners." Robinson Lifestyle is committed to supporting its partners' needs, using a Business Partnership approach for both large and small partners. This commitment includes comprehensive support such as: 

*   **Financial & Funding Support:** Acting as an intermediary to secure investors and business operators with expertise in various fields, helping partners achieve sustainable and stable growth.
*   **Business Management Support:** Providing marketing consultation and performance analysis to help partners make more effective, targeted adjustments more quickly. 

In addition to business goals, Robinson Lifestyle is dedicated to giving back to the community, aiming to improve quality of life across three key areas: education, economy, and the environment. 

*   **Education** 
    

*   *   Creating spaces within shopping centers as Art & Culture Lifestyle hubs, fostering youth development by showcasing works from local artists.
    *   Collaborating with provincial chambers of commerce and government agencies to organise educational events that promote continuous learning opportunities. Examples include the Student Fun Fair at the Ratchaphruek branch, World Environment Week activities with the Office of Natural Resources and Environment of Samut Prakan Province, and traditional Thai arts performances in partnership with Bankanokwan Nadtasin in Saraburi Province. 

*   **Economy** 
    

*   *   Supporting SME growth within shopping centers through collaborative business planning and year-round marketing activities that stimulate local economic activity, benefiting business owners, creating employment, and generating income for the community, thus contributing to sustainable long-term economic growth.
*   **Environment** 

*   *   From 2017 to September 2024, Robinson Lifestyle installed solar rooftops at 26 branch locations, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 108,681 tons of CO₂—equivalent to planting over 150,000 trees.
    *   Responding to the rising use of electric vehicles (EVs) by installing 30 EV Charging Stations, with expansion plans starting at the Thalang branch and continuing nationwide.

In addition to its core values of prioritising customers, partners, and society, the organisation is committed to enhancing employee quality of life. Every team member is regarded as a crucial part of the company, with positive results stemming from a solid foundation. After gathering employee input, the "Life is Good, Vibe is Happy" project was launched to create a more enjoyable work environment. This initiative focuses on improving employee benefits, including: 

*   **Renovating Robinson Lifestyle's headquarters** into an open space to foster a more relaxed work atmosphere, encouraging inspiration and happiness at work. Key improvements include:

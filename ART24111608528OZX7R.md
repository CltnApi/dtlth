ONE Championship contract eludes Stephen Irvine despite win at ONE Friday Fights 87

Stephen Irvine was left waiting on a ONE Championship contract again despite racking up his fifth win at ONE Lumpinee on Friday night in Bangkok.

“El Matador” put in a dominant performance to see off a game opponent in Denkriangkrai Singha Mawynn, securing a unanimous decision in the co-main event of ONE Friday Fights 87.

It took his record to 5-1 with three finishes under the ONE promotional banner – his only blemish a majority decision loss to Singdomthong Nokjeanladkrabang in October 2023.

The 24-year-old Scot, who announced this week he is set to become a father for the first time, vowed to earn a US$100,000 contract but did not even pick up a 350,000 baht bonus for his impressive performance – nor was he granted an in-ring interview at Lumpinee Stadium.

“Stevie put on a masterclass, pulled out all the stops, and used all of his weapons today,” his coach JP Gallacher said. 

“No knockout. so no contract, but three very valuable rounds under his belt. Dynamite performance – he dominated the whole fight. So, so pleased with it.” 

It was a good night for Gallacher, whose JP Mansion Muay Thai team went 3-0 at Lumpinee Stadium. 

Nico Carrillo was also in their corner, as he gets set for his title fight with ONE bantamweight Muay Thai king Superlek Kiatmookao at ONE 170 in January.

Their teammate Payaksurin Sit JP came back from a second-round knockdown to secure a bonus from ONE CEO Chatri Sityodtong for a third-round TKO win over Pettapee Rongrienkelasurat, in their 122lbs catchweight Muay Thai bout on Friday.

“Always bet on us, this is our house,” Gallacher told the Bangkok Post.

“Payaksurin walked onto a big left hand and got dropped but he immediately regained control and switched on, scored a knockdown back, and then KO’d his opponent,” Gallacher added in a social media post.

“Huge improvements shown, beautiful boxing. Shot selection was great. His first fight under me, and his first KO and bonus on ONE. Immense heart shown by this kid – so, so proud of him.” 

“I have to keep fighting and stand up for myself and my team,” the 19-year-old Thai said. “Thank you so much Khun Chatri for giving me this opportunity and my bonus. I tried hard, and I wanted to perform.”

Another of Gallacher’s charges, Singdomthong, also earned a bonus for a first round knockout of Watcharaphon Singha Mawynn.

“Singdomthong was flawless, and came out like a rocket with a first-round KO,” Gallacher said.

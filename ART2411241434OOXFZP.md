Sarawut Petchapanomporn, a candidate from the ruling **Pheu Thai Party** who received support from former prime minister **Thaksin Shinawatra**, appears likely to win the provincial administrative organisation chairman election in Udon Thani province on Sunday.

At 8pm when the vote count was 54% completed, he had received 203,078 votes while the first runner-up, Kanisorn Khurirang from the opposition-core **People’s Party** (PP), had 165,024 votes.

Thaksin, father of Pheu Thai leader **Paetongtarn Shinawatra,** campaigned for Mr Sarawut in the northeastern province on Nov 13 and 14. He told supporters on that occasion that Pheu Thai needed a landslide; otherwise, he would be embarrassed.

Political observers viewed the provincial election as a test of the political strength and popularity of Pheu Thai and PP ahead of the next general election.

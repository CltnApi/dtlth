In 2002, Louis Vuitton debuted in the watchmaking industry with the inaugural Tambour beating in a drum-shaped case. Its reinvention signifies a new era of the maison's horology led by watch director Jean Arnault.

The new and slimmer Tambour firstly boasts an integrated bracelet that melds seamlessly into a case with a diameter of 40mm and a lug-free construction. The rounded profile of the bracelet links maintains continuous contact with the wrist while the caseback ascends in an arc for a comfortable fit.

Touching the timepiece gives a feel of the meticulous craftsmanship. For instance, the drum-shaped polished crown is fluted with distinct yet soft grooves for sensual winding.

A Tambour hallmark, the 12 letters of Louis Vuitton on the sandblasted bezel are now raised and polished, with each minutely sculpted letter in line with an hour marker on the dial.

The design plays with crisp and sharply delineated elements on the dial, in contrast to the taut curves of the case and bracelet.

Tucked below the snailed small-seconds counter, FAB. EN SUISSE refers to La Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton, which executed the elevated craftsmanship for the latest Tambour.

The outer and inner rings for the minuterie and hours with micro-sandblasted surfaces lead to the central brushed section of the dial with another new statement of identity, LOUIS VUITTON PARIS.

Despite being just over a millimetre thick, the dial with the split-level chapter ring divided by a polished step, conveys depth and three-dimensionality. The difference in the height of the recessed 5-minute and applique hour markers allows for instant reading as light interacts variably between them.

The gold indexes are diamond polished to amplify their interaction with the light. In dim conditions, the legibility is enhanced by numerals and hands filled with Super-LumiNova. Notably, the gold hands have evolved from broad batons into a tapered and facetted openworked design.

The new collection comprises stainless steel, yellow gold and rose gold models with the dial in a different colour. In addition, stainless steel pairs with rose gold for an appealing two-tone version.

The upgrade also introduces the first proprietary automatic three-hand movement designed by Louis Vuitton in conjunction with Le Cercle des Horlogers.

The calibre LFT023 is adorned with the maison's visual codes, such as the barrel cover with openwork reminiscent of a Monogram Flower and the micro-rotor decorated with a stylised LV in a repeating motif.

A circular-grained mainplate is a nod to traditional movement decoration while colourless transparent jewels replace conventional magenta rubies for contemporary aesthetic.

Demonstrating Louis Vuitton's commitment to horological excellence, the calibre LFT023 with a power reserve of 50 hours is chronometer certified by the Geneva Chronometric Observatory under the auspices of the TIMELAB Foundation.

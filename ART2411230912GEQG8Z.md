Piriya Vachajitpan, co-founder of the Art Auction Centre, said: “Displaying art and automobiles together in the Driven exhibition creates a unique combination. While they may seem different, they connect seamlessly through their distinctive allure, shared craftsmanship, and the passion and inspiration of their creators.”

Visitors to the exhibition will experience a blend of the art and technology worlds, gaining inspiration and fresh perspectives, Piriya said. The event goes beyond showcasing art; it provides an opportunity to explore the essence of "drive", the power of both art and innovation.

**Thawan Duchanee, “Fishing Boat” (1967), Oil on Canvas**

Piriya described this piece as a semi-abstract depiction of a fishing boat set against a backdrop of soft, interwoven green and blue tones, brimming with emotion.

This significant piece once adorned the dining hall of the Jusmagthai organisation during the Vietnam War. It is considered a rare work reflecting clear Western influences during the period when Thawan had just graduated from studying abroad.

**Thawan Duchanee, “Fish” (1967), Ink on Paper**

A pivotal time in Thawan's life was his studies in Amsterdam, supported by a modest scholarship that barely covered living expenses. Dining luxuriously was an unattainable dream, but through his skill, he could craft a vivid world of imagination.

The artwork portrays two outstretched hands as if declaring triumph in stripping the fish to its bare bones, emphasising the artist's resilience and resourcefulness during his formative years.

**Pratuang Emjaroen, “Universal Lovers” (1994), Oil on Canvas**

This work was featured in the book The Spirit of Art. It captures the infinite expanse of the universe, where countless stars perish, some exploding to give birth to new stellar streams. Amid the chaotic dispersion of matter, universal forces draw entities together, bringing lovers to meet within the vast cosmos.

Pratuang Emjaroen conveys the beauty of this abstract phenomenon through vibrant complementary colours and intricate details. His meticulous lines emphasise the energy exchanged between celestial bodies, reflecting their profound connection.

**Damrong Wong-Uparaj, “Golden Mount” (1961), Oil on Wood Panel**

Piriya described this rare masterpiece by Damrong as a radiant gem created during the artist’s National Art Exhibition award-winning era.

The painting showcases meticulous details, from the interwoven textures of wood grain to the patterns on wall panels and the precise depiction of roofing materials, all executed with remarkable realism.

It presents Golden Mount (Phu Khao Thong) alongside traditional Thai architecture and lifestyles, filtered through the artist’s introspective lens. Using a vertical composition inspired by modern art, the piece embodies the harmony between daily life and spiritual faith, intertwining them seamlessly.

**Chatchai Puipia, “Untitled” (2013), Oil on Canvas**

Nature, time, and the changing seasons encapsulate the cyclical nature of human life – birth, culmination, and dissolution. Chatchai portrays solitude, introspection, and inner awareness through this piece, expressing profound thoughts and emotions with serene facial expressions and subtle colour tones.

Butterflies fluttering around serve as symbols of transformation and growth, reflecting humanity’s journey of acceptance and the return to simplicity, ultimately reconnecting with the earth.

**Prayoon Uluchadha, “Boy” (1996), Pastel on Paper**

With a brushstroke of vibrant colours and the Pointillism technique, Prayoon Uluchadha weaves an intricate visual narrative where tiny dots merge seamlessly, creating depth and dimension. This method combines Impressionist aesthetics with abstract elements, amplifying the emotional resonance of the piece.

The dreamlike, shimmering background evokes a fleeting sense of motion, as if viewed through a prism scattering light. At its centre is a young boy – a poignant symbol of reality, simultaneously part of and yet distinct from the surrounding world. The artwork captures the fleeting innocence of youth, inviting contemplation of life’s untold stories awaiting discovery.

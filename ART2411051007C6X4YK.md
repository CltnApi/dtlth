The Exhibition Industry Summit 2024, Thailand's first exclusive event hosted by the Thailand Convention and Exhibition Bureau (TCEB), was a major success, underscoring Thailand’s strong potential as a leading exhibition destination. High-ranking executives from Europe and Asia’s top exhibition organisations expressed confidence in Thailand’s capability and readiness, attributing it to the Thai government’s clear policy for promoting the exhibition industry, excellent infrastructure, open business culture, and renowned hospitality. In seeking to expand their networks with Thai partners, participants also recommended that the local industry embrace advanced digital technologies to address evolving exhibition needs. 

Held under the theme “See Tomorrow Now,” the summit aimed to help delegates and participants envision future business opportunities in Thailand. These insights will guide their strategic planning, leveraging exhibitions as a launchpad for growth in Thailand’s business landscape. 

TCEB President Mr. Chiruit Isarangkun Na Ayuthaya stated, “The Exhibition Industry Summit 2024 was a resounding success, offering tremendous benefits for Thailand. For the first time, leading exhibition organisers from Europe and Asia gathered in Thailand to gain firsthand insights into the country's vision and strategies for exhibition development. This event is pivotal in shaping their venue choices for future events. We also received invaluable recommendations on development areas to propel the exhibition industry forward and respond effectively to global market shifts.”

The event included a meeting with Thai Prime Minister Ms. Paetongtarn Shinawatra, led by Mr. Prasert Jantararuangtong, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Economy and Society, and Dr. Pasu Loharjun, Chairman of TCEB’s Board. The Prime Minister reaffirmed the government’s support to establish Thailand as a premier exhibition destination and announced plans for a One Stop Service System to streamline exhibition logistics, promote innovation, and drive sustainable economic growth. 

Leaders participated in a roundtable discussion with Thai government officials, including the Vice Minister for Tourism and Sport, Deputy Secretary to the Prime Minister, and the Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society. They reiterated the importance of exhibitions as a critical economic driver and an attraction for foreign direct investment (FDI), benefiting related industries and aligning with the government’s policy to promote high-value tourism, including exhibitions, which already contribute 12% of Thailand’s GDP.

The summit also included a forum where industry leaders discussed Thailand’s economic potential and high-growth industries, with keynote speeches on “Shaping Thailand’s Future in the Global Value Chain” by experts from the International Financial Corporation and the Thailand Development and Research Institute. A panel discussion on “Thailand’s Economic Potential and Integration into ASEAN: Future Frontiers” featured leaders from the medical, fintech, technology, and automotive sectors. The forum concluded with insights on “Exhibition Industry Strengths and Emerging Trends” from prominent industry figures. 

Key trends highlighted included: 

1.  **Customised Service****:** Exhibition organisers are encouraged to create experiences that accommodate evolving lifestyles, offering services like telecommunications to support work-life balance for participants.
2.  **AI Adoption****:** Use of AI in areas like big data management and translation to enhance visitor experience.
3.  **Venue Selection****:** Venues must provide both top-tier facilities and a welcoming atmosphere. Thailand’s excellent infrastructure, extensive offsite activities, and renowned hospitality position it well to meet these demands. 

TCEB also showcased Thailand’s commitment to sustainability through the use of hybrid vehicles and electric boats for transport, a gala dinner with local ingredients, and waste minimisation initiatives. The summit embraced Thai culture with event décor featuring authentic Thai art, a Khon mask performance, and interactive puppet shows, blending business and culture for an unforgettable experience.

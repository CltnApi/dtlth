The summit serves as a significant forum for collaboration among the 21 economies of the Asia-Pacific region, which includes Australia, Canada, China, Chile, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Peru, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand, with joint summits held annually.



Since its inception in 1989, APEC has facilitated multilateral economic and trade discussions, enhancing cooperation in social and development areas and advancing prosperity, sustainable, and inclusive economic growth. Currently, the group member economies represent about 62% of the world's GDP and 48% of the world's trade.

Meanwhile, if the negotiations for the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific succeed, this collaboration could lead to the formation of the world's largest economic framework.

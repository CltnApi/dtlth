Forty-one **cadavers** used in meditation practices at a Buddhist **monastery** in Phichit province are being identified in a police investigation to determine whether they were obtained legally.

Authorities are gathering more information about the cadavers at Pa Nakhon Chaibovorn monastery in Pho Thale district and review documentation about their storage to determine if any wrongdoing occurred, Pol Maj Gen Tadej Klomkliang, chief of Phichit provincial police, said on Saturday

He stressed the need to verify whether the deceased died from natural causes, despite the monastery's claim that the bodies had been donated by faithful members.

The National Office of Buddhism has also been asked to evaluate the monastery’s assertions about mental training and ritualistic practices, which may conflict with Buddhist principles.

Kom Pattarakulprasert, director of the Phichit Office of Buddhism, visited the monastery, run by Phra Ajarn Saifon Phandito, to observe the meditation practices. The inclusion of deceased bodies in meditation was a new and unusual approach, he said.

"I asked Phra Ajarn Saifon Phandito if there were any cadavers and was told that there were none," Mr Kom said.

"But when journalists discovered the 41 bodies, I was taken aback by the conflicting stories. I will discuss whether this practice is appropriate with the local head of the clergy."

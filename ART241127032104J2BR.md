Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited (Bangchak) has partnered with the King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL), CMKL University, and the King Mongkut’s Hospital Foundation in the Patriarch's Patronage to advance medical innovation, biotechnology, and sustainable healthcare. The collaboration was formalised through a memorandum of understanding signed during a ceremony at King Mongkut Chaokhunthahan Hospital. 

The signing ceremony brought together key leaders, including Mr. Chaiwat Kovavisarach, Group Chief Executive Officer and President of Bangchak Corporation; Professor Dr. Anan Srikiatkhachorn, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at KMITL; Professor Suchatvee Suwansawat, President of King Mongkut’s Hospital Foundation in the Patriarch’s Patronage; Associate Professor Dr. Supan Tungjitkusolmun, President of CMKL University; and Assistant Professor Dr. Somsak Walairacht, Deputy Director of King Mongkut Chaokhunthahan Hospital, representing the hospital’s director, Associate Professor Prasert Trivijitsilp, M.D. 

The collaboration aims to create a significant impact by spearheading innovative solutions across biotechnology research and establishing a medical technology hub. Bangchak’s innovation arm, the Bangchak Initiative and Innovation Center (BiiC), will play a pivotal role in connecting researchers, investors, and business partners to strengthen the innovation network and promote sustainable development. 

Key initiatives include advancing telemedicine technology to ensure modern healthcare is more accessible to a broader population and developing artificial intelligence applications for medical and public health purposes. Additionally, the partnership will see the integration of sustainable solutions such as electric vehicle charging stations and Inthanin Coffee outlets—Thailand’s leading eco-friendly coffee brand—at King Mongkut Chaokhunthahan Hospital. 

This collaboration underscores Bangchak’s commitment to fostering transformative medical innovations that align with its broader goals of health and environmental sustainability, while also enhancing healthcare accessibility and technological progress in Thailand.

The **"One Good Habit, Love the Earth" campaign** by **Taiwan Excellence** has successfully concluded, engaging over **1,300 participants** in a shared mission to adopt sustainable habits and take meaningful steps toward a greener planet. Combining online and onsite activities, the campaign demonstrated how small, impactful actions can collectively lead to significant change for the environment.

The **online challenge**, launched in early November, invited participants to choose one sustainable habit from a list of **14 impactful actions** and commit to it consistently for **21 days**, from **November 1 to 21, 2024**. Participants documented their efforts by sharing photos and posts on social media, using hashtags such as **#TaiwanExcellence, #OneGoodHabit**, and **#TELoveTheEarth**. Popular habits included bringing reusable bottles, reducing waste through recycling, and conserving energy by unplugging unused devices.

To further extend the campaign’s impact and provide an opportunity for those who couldn’t join the full 21-day online challenge, Taiwan Excellence brought the initiative to life at the **Taiwan Excellence Pavilion during TAIWAN EXPO**, held at the **Queen Sirikit National Convention Center from November 21-23, 2024**. The onsite **"One Good Habit, Love the Earth: Booth Challenge"** allowed visitors to actively participate in the campaign. Visitors selected one of the 14 sustainability actions, took a photo to symbolise their commitment, and shared it on social media with campaign hashtags.

For those unable to complete the 21-day online challenge, the onsite activity offered a chance to commit to **five consecutive days of action** from **November 24 to 28, 2024****,** maintaining the campaign’s spirit of inclusivity and impact. 

Participants embraced habits across four categories—**Food & Living, Environment, Energy & Mobility, and Others**—tailoring their actions to their lifestyles and needs. From adopting reusable shopping bags to raising awareness about sustainability in their communities, participants made meaningful contributions to environmental preservation. 

Taiwan Excellence’s **"One Good Habit, Love the Earth" campaign** reflects the brand’s ongoing dedication to **sustainability and innovation**. By encouraging individuals to take **small but consistent actions**, the initiative successfully demonstrated that creating a greener future starts with everyday habits. The campaign not only inspired participants but also reinforced Taiwan Excellence’s position as a leader in promoting **eco-friendly practices** through its products and initiatives.

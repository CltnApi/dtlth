Thai marine scientists have initiated a groundbreaking project to cultivate seagrass beds, aiming to safeguard the critically endangered dugong population.

The director-general of the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, **Dr. Pinsak Suraswadi**, expressed deep concern over the declining health of seagrass habitats, particularly in the Andaman Sea region.

_**"Seagrass is essential for dugongs, providing food, shelter, and a healthy environment," he said.**_

In October alone, eight dugongs were found dead across four southern provinces. An autopsy revealed that the animals were consuming alternative foods like seaweed, but Dr Suraswadi noted: _**"Algae is still just a supplement for dugongs. It cannot be a staple food instead of seagrass."**_

Recent studies have revealed a significant decline in both the area and density of seagrass beds in key dugong habitats such as Krabi, Trang, and Satun provinces. This alarming trend has led to malnutrition and increased mortality among the dugong population.

In response to this crisis, the department has begun preparing feeding plots with alternative vegetation, such as Cantonese vegetables at Rawai Beach and Libong Island. Observations indicate that dugongs are responding positively to these supplementary food sources.

Meanwhile, the department has implemented several strategies to address this pressing issue, including seagrass cultivation, feeding programs, and public awareness.



Dr Pinsak explained that scientists are currently cultivating seagrass seedlings in nurseries and transplanting them into degraded areas.

Meanwhile, supplementary feeding stations have been set up in critical habitats to provide dugongs with alternative food sources such as vegetables and algae. In addition, the department is working to raise public awareness about the importance of seagrass conservation and the threats to dugong populations.

_**"Seagrass is the lifeblood of our marine ecosystems. By protecting seagrass, we are not only safeguarding dugongs but also preserving a vital habitat for countless other marine species," he said.**_

While these efforts offer hope for the future of dugongs, Pinsak emphasised the need for long-term solutions. The department is calling for public cooperation to assist in the conservation of these rare marine animals, urging stakeholders to "**help conserve and supervise rare marine animals**". They encourage reporting through the Marine and Forest Protection Hotline at 1362.

_**"We must continue to monitor the health of seagrass, reduce human impacts on coastal ecosystems, and implement effective conservation measures to ensure the survival of these magnificent creatures," Pinsak said.**_

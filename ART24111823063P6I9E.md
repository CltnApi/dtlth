The planned appointment of the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) to negotiate with **Cambodia** on the development of **disputed maritime areas** in the **Gulf of Thailand** might not be tabled for the cabinet's consideration Tuesday.

Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said it is possible the appointment of the JTC will not be ready to be considered, despite speculation it will be approved by the cabinet on Tuesday.

According to Mr Phumtham, who is widely tipped to head the JTC, it remains to be seen if Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who just returned from the Apec summit in Peru, is ready to chair the weekly cabinet meeting.

Mr Phumtham, who also serves as defence minister, said he will attend the Asean Defence Ministers' Meeting Plus in Laos on Tuesday.

The deputy prime minister reiterated that the 2001 MoU is considered the best framework for both countries to use to resolve the maritime border dispute and urged those who questioned its merits to study it thoroughly.

Thai Pakdee Party Chairman Warong Dechgitvigrom, who is leading a campaign for the revocation of the MoU, wrote on Facebook that more than 100,000 people have signed in support of his campaign. The petition will be submitted to the prime minister on Friday.

Meanwhile, former senator Kamnoon Sidhisamarn wrote on Facebook on Monday that the 2001 MoU is designed to simultaneously speed up negotiations on the maritime border and natural resources.

Thailand and Cambodia both claim sovereignty of the overlapping claim area (OCA), which covers about 26,000 square kilometres of the Gulf of Thailand. The area is believed to be rich in fossil fuel energy resources. Cambodia made its initial claim in 1972, which Thailand rejected. The following year, Thailand made a counterclaim.

Mr Kamnoon said that during talks from 2001-2005, Cambodia did not respond to Thailand's counterclaim and it still has not made any response.

Thailand's counterclaim was raised at the ministerial level by the Thai delegation, and the Cambodian delegation only agreed to submit the issue to its government for further consideration.

According to Mr Kamnoon, the Thai Foreign Ministry will welcome Cambodia agreeing to this proposal because future negotiations under the 201 MoU would align with Thailand's proposed maritime boundary.

However, he said that if Cambodia agrees to Thailand's counterclaim, Thailand stands to both gain and lose whereas Cambodia stands to primarily lose.

In the event Cambodia agrees to Thailand's counterclaim, it will nullify its 1972 claim to the area, he said.

While the Thai Foreign Ministry is adamant about Thailand's sovereignty over Koh Kut, he noted that if Cambodia officially withdrew its claim, it would eliminate any lingering disputes.

According to Mr Kamnoon, Cambodia remains convinced that at least half of Koh Kut belongs to it.

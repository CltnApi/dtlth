Thai Oil Public Company Limited (Thaioil) has earned an “Excellent CGR Rating” for the 16th consecutive year, signified by the prestigious 5-symbol distinction—the highest level of recognition. The company is also ranked within the top quartile of listed companies with a market capitalisation of no less than 10 billion baht.

Sweden Leads Waste Management, Inspiring Thailand’s e-Waste Future

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0addf7c0-6f15-4622-b8a9-400a5805fae3)

Sweden stands as one of the world’s most efficient nations in waste management, driven by the principle that "there is no such thing as waste, only resources out of place." This philosophy has been fully embraced through comprehensive policies, legislation, and collaboration across all sectors of society, transforming Sweden into a nation that is nearly free of waste.

In 1967, Sweden became the first country to pass an Environmental Protection Act. Today, more than 60% of the electricity consumed in Sweden is generated from renewable energy sources. The nation has set an ambitious goal to become completely fossil fuel-free by 2045. To achieve this, Sweden has implemented stringent and multi-faceted policies, including sustainable development frameworks and the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) legislation. Under EPR, manufacturers, importers, and distributors are held accountable for the full lifecycle of their products. Additional measures, such as landfill taxes and circular economy strategies, enable Sweden to uphold its high standards in waste management and environmental protection.

**“Manufacturers – Importers – Distributors” Embracing Responsibility under the Circular Economy Framework**

One of Sweden's key strategies for managing electronic waste, implemented for over 20 years, is the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). Mrs Anna Hammargren, the Ambassador of Sweden to Thailand, emphasised that manufacturers, importers, and distributors are responsible for the full lifecycle of their products, including collection, recycling, and disposal. This system not only reduces waste but also incentivises companies to design products with recycling and sustainability in mind, promoting a circular economy.

**“Prevention” as the Top Priority for Engaging with Sustainability**

Sweden’s waste hierarchy prioritises reducing waste generation and maximising the reuse and recycling of materials.

*   **Prevention:** The highest priority is reducing the amount of waste generated by designing products that use fewer resources and have a longer lifespan.
*   **Reuse:** Encourages repairing and refurbishing products to extend their usability.
*   **Material Recycling:** Focuses on processing waste materials into new products.
*   **Energy Recovery:** Involves recovering energy from non-recyclable waste, reducing landfill volumes while providing a renewable energy source.
*   **Landfill:** The least favourable option due to its environmental impact.

In 2023, Sweden collected 1.6 million tonnes of bulky waste. Thanks to its efficient waste management practices, 40% of this waste was recycled, 56% underwent energy recovery, and only 4% was sent to landfill.

**“Collaboration – Regulation: Key Drivers of Success in e-Waste Management”**

Mrs Anna Hammargren shared insights on how Thailand could enhance its e-waste recycling processes: “Adopting policies similar to EPR would be highly beneficial. By implementing regulations that hold producers accountable for the end-of-life treatment of electronics, Thailand could establish a more structured and efficient e-waste management system. Better collection systems and recycling infrastructure would ensure that valuable materials are recovered and harmful substances safely disposed of.”

Educating the public about proper e-waste management is crucial. Increased awareness of the dangers of improper disposal and the benefits of recycling can foster a culture of sustainability.

“One of the key factors behind Sweden’s success in sustainable waste practices is the dedication of Swedish households in actively separating waste into categories like food waste, packaging, electronics, and batteries. Drawing inspiration from Sweden, Thailand has an invaluable opportunity to strengthen its e-waste management practices, contributing to a healthier environment and a more sustainable future for all,” said Mrs Hammargren.

**The New Generation as a Catalyst for e-Waste Management**

According to Mrs Anna Hammargren, the Ambassador of Sweden to Thailand, the younger generation holds a pivotal role in advancing waste management practices, particularly in addressing e-waste. In Sweden, individuals actively separate and recycle materials such as plastics, metals, and electronics, recognising the benefits to both the environment and public health. Cultivating a similar mindset among Thailand’s youth can lead to significant progress. Ultimately, sustainable waste management requires not only producers to act responsibly but also a shift in public behaviour.

Students and young professionals in Thailand can contribute by organising e-waste collection drives, promoting responsible consumption, and championing waste management technologies. Collaborations with local businesses and tech startups can lead to innovative, sustainable solutions for managing e-waste effectively.

**True Corporation: A Leader in e-Waste Management**

True Corporation acknowledges its responsibility to ensure comprehensive e-waste management in line with international standards. Together with dtac, True has spearheaded the ongoing “e-Waste TinkTookTee DTorJai” initiative, aiming to reduce landfill waste to zero by providing a secure and efficient system for collecting, transporting, and recycling e-waste.

In addition to offering recycling services, True is inspiring the next generation to drive change through its “e-Waste HACK BKK 2024” initiative. This programme, in collaboration with the Embassy of Sweden in Thailand and various partner organisations, engages young innovators to develop creative solutions for repurposing discarded electronics. By fostering environmental awareness and empowering innovators, True Corporation is turning e-waste challenges into opportunities to create sustainable value for society.

“Events like e-Waste HACK BKK provide an excellent platform for young people to apply their creativity and technical skills in developing actionable solutions to address Bangkok’s e-waste challenges. By fostering education, collaboration, and innovation, we can partner with Thailand toward a more sustainable future,” Mrs Hammargren concluded.Bottom of Form

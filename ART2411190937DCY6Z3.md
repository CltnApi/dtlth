Two young Australian women are fighting for their lives in Thai hospitals after drinking **tainted alcohol** in the tourist town of Vang Vieng in Laos.

The parents of the two 19-year-olds from Melbourne are at their bedsides in separate Thai hospitals — one in Bangkok and the other in Udon Thani, the [Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-19/laos-melbourne-teenagers-suspected-methanol-poisoning/104617302) on Tuesday.

Holly Bowles and Bianca Jones were staying at a backpacker hostel in Vang Vieng, a popular party town north of the Lao capital, Vientiane.

According to the owner of the Nana Hostel, the young women had been out drinking at a nearby bar on the night of Tuesday, Nov 12. In the early hours of Wednesday morning, they were taken to a hospital in Vientiane after falling ill.

Two Danish women in their 20s died and at least 10 people have fallen ill after drinking the tainted alcohol, according to local reports.

Ms Bowles was transferred to a hospital in Bangkok and Ms Jones was taken to Udon Thani after their conditions worsened.

“Our beautiful Bianca was on a dream getaway with her best friend Holly,” the family of Ms Jones said in a statement.

“They were filled with joy and had such incredible adventures ahead of them, travelling through Asia.

“We are here by Bianca’s bedside praying for her.”

Duong Van Huan, the owner of the Nana Hostel in Vang Vieng, told ABC he was sure the poisoned drinks were not sold at his bar, saying none of the other hostel guests fell ill.

He said he had been in business in Vientiane and Vang Vieng for almost 11 years, and it was the first time something like this had happened.

Methanol is a clear liquid chemical that is often illegally added to alcoholic beverages as a cheaper alternative to ethanol.

Consuming even a small amount can be fatal.

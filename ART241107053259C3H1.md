In a post-Covid world, technology is changing the future of spa treatments. New spa trends include biohacking, spiritual wellbeing, sleep optimisation and eco-design. 

A relatively new term, biohacking is the practice of using methods drawn from biology, genetics, neuroscience and nutrition to enhance physical or mental performance, which improves overall health and wellbeing.

At the forefront of using biohacking as one of its primary fields of treatments is Mello Spa in Seminyak, Bali, an island that is no stranger to spiritual wellbeing. In fact, it is enshrined with it at every corner.

Founded by Australian entrepreneurs Dr Mumtaz and Fatima Khan, Mello offers a curated blend of indulgence and results-driven treatments in a designed environment. “We believe that true luxury lies in personalisation. Each treatment begins with an in-depth consultation, ensuring every facial, massage and wellness ritual is bespoke to your needs and desires,” says Khan.

The brother-sister duo realised a gap in the Balinese spa industry  — a disconnect between industry standard, effective treatments and what luxury means to people. “I’ve done extensive research into biohacking and its proponents. Obviously our staff have prior knowledge, but we’ve taught them the finer details and where to find further educational material so that they can educate themselves,” says Dr Khan.

“We have a Mello manual, which offers everything our staff need to know with regards to resources. This is beyond the verbal instruction,” says Dr Khan.

There are very few stand-alone spas on the island that cater to spa treatments with a focus on biohacking. “Mello isn’t the place you come for a normal facial. We do a skin analysis before starting a facial and the facial is catered to your skin type. The one thing we’ve learned is that there isn’t one facial for various skin types. All our products cater to a variety of skin types and if we get new products, they are added to the manual, which includes where they are sourced, with a list of the ingredients and what skin types they are best suited for,” says Dr Khan. 

“We use science technology to change the biological behaviour of the body. This doesn’t meant that we are genetically manipulating your body. It is using the understanding of science and technology to change the way your body behaves and responds to certain stimuli,” adds Khan. 

Mello uses products from different companies to change the way skin responds to them, especially with their chemical peels. “If you’re doing a peel, you’re biohacking your skin because you're exfoliating. But the peel also increases the speed of regenerating new cells. So without this biohack on your skin, it wouldn’t have regenerated new cells,” explains Dr Khan. 

Though traditional biohacking methods like ice baths and saunas are all the rage, they also are changing the way your body responds to them. “In the beauty world, it's relatively new,”says Khan. 

Light therapy is also a form of biohacking. Using different types of lights to target different parts of the body became a trend during Covid when people were stuck at home. “Blue light is used to target acne-prone skin and it helps clear the bacteria in affected region. Whereas, red light is used for healing, increased collagen formation, rejuvenation. The infrared light is geared more towards a healing process,” says Dr Khan. 

However, biohacking doesn’t just apply to facials and skincare. It also applies to massage and Gua Sha. “With our body treatments, the aim is to regenerate and biohack the body in order to try and get those cortisol levels down. This is where massage therapy comes in. We’ve instructed staff that clients come to Mello for a reason, be it tiredness, sadness or just a quick pick-me-up. They come here to feel good. The energy flow from the therapists body to the client's body is important as it helps with the production of cortisol,” explains Dr Khan. 

The therapists at Mello, therefore, “listen and tune-in to your body, sees how it responds, how it feels and will only then recommend a massage treatment,” adds Dr Khan. 

Another thing that Mello focuses is on is medical-grade hygiene. All the equipment uses medical grade sterilisation, which is housed in a separate room and is looked after one highly-trained staff member. 

Music is also taken to account at Mello. “We wanted to get away from the typical spa music. We have three playlists from which clients can choose from or they can play their own music. This is a great way to ultra relaxation,” adds Khan. 

The signature treatments feature Gua Sha, done with a rose quartz or a copper tool. “This comes down to the philosophy of biohacking. The copper gives you better stimulation to detoxify and stimulate your lymphatic system. From a medical perspective, this sometimes can be too aggressive on certain skin types. That’s where the rose quartz comes in to promote blood flow,” says Dr Khan.

An in-house standard called the “Mello Way” forms the foundation inside the walls of Mello. However, the principles of biohacking don’t only pertain to the body and self. It is also incorporated in the design of the spa. Designed by Samma Studio, alongside furniture designers The Medium, Mello creates an immersive experience with temperature-controlled beds and soothing lighting. This meticulous attention to detail helps craft the perfect "Mello Moment”, allowing each client to discover their own interpretation of Mello. 

Going a step further is the Mello Foundation, which provides comprehensive training programmes for Balinese women, equipping them with valuable skills and fostering greater autonomy. Get on that flight to Bali, now!

**Awakening Bangkok** will return to Phra Nakhon district for the second time to illuminate the old town for 10 nights starting this Friday, until Nov 17.

This is the seventh edition of Bangkok's annual light and digital art festival which promises to bring more than 30 digital art installations by local and international designers, as well as students from various universities.

The theme for this year's festival is "One Light, One Rises", emphasising that light and digital art not only reawaken historic areas but also ignite inspiration and motivate people.

The event will feature four interconnected walking routes, each telling the story of four sub-themes -- "Sustainability" at Pak Khlong Talat; "Prosperity" at Sanam Chai; "Inclusivity" at Sao Ching Cha; and "Positivity" at Sam Yot.

The main display locations include Yodpiman River Walk, Museum Siam, Saranrom Park, Bangkok City Hall and Rommaninat Park. There will also be several interactive displays, as well as live music performances scheduled for this Saturday and Sunday and Nov 16 at Yodpiman River Walk.

Visitors are invited to explore the historic district from a new perspective, reawakened through light and digital art, daily from 6pm to 11pm, free of charge.

The event is easily accessible by MRT at Sanam Chai and Sam Yot stations.

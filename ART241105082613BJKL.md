ONE Championship’s Rungrawee sorry for George Jarvis loss, will undergo scans on knee injury

Rungrawee Sitsongpeenong will go for scans on a severe knee injury after his dramatic loss to George Jarvis at ONE Friday Fights 85.

“Legatron” was assessed by medical staff at Lumpinee Stadium following a third-round KO, which earned Jarvis a US$100,000 ONE Championship contract.

Doctors suspected a meniscus tear, with the 28-year-old Thai to undergo an MRI in his hometown of Korat, around three hours outside Bangkok, on Saturday.

“I felt my knee go in the first round and it just got worse and worse. I wasn’t able to kick and knee properly,” Rungrawee told the Bangkok Post.

“ONE has said they will take care of all the costs for this injury and I’m very thankful to this organisation and to Chatri \[Sityodtong, ONE CEO\].”

Rungrawee, who himself came through the ranks at ONE Lumpinee and earned a contract in May 2023, had been on a two-fight win streak in ONE Championship and knocking on the door for a title shot.  

But he said he after a few kicks in the opening round he brought his leg down and felt a snap in his knee when it touched the floor.

“I’m really disappointed. I thought I could have won,” he added. “This fight would have led to good things if I won. I want to say sorry to all the Thai fans.”

Jarvis was initially denied a contract, despite a second straight win over a contracted ONE Championship fighter.

But in a dramatic twist, he was called back to the ring later in the evening and told Chatri had changed his mind.

“I want to congratulate George on the win and on getting the contract, and to thank him for a good fight,” added Rungrawee, who has over 200 professional fights to his name. 

“He put up a really good fight. I’ll be back. I’m sorry, everyone.”

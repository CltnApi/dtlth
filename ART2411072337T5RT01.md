Obec probes school food, donation accusations

The Office of the Basic Education Commission (Obec) has inspected two schools in Chachoengsao and Nakhon Ratchasima after allegations were made online that one of them served spoiled fruits in student meals while the other was over soliciting parents for donations for a school van.

Obec secretary-general Thanu Wongchinda yesterday responded to public criticism regarding the misconduct claims of the two schools circulating on social media. He said the issues have been probed by the Obec's provincial offices and the Obec's Happiness and Safety Centre.

According to Sub Lt Thanu, the investigation into a school in Chachoengsao that was alleged to serve spoiled food found no evidence to support the claim.

The students interviewed reported that they had not consumed spoiled vegetables or fruit and had not experienced any food-related illnesses.

He said all students confirmed they had adequate meals daily and, therefore, Obec concluded that this claim was unfounded.

In Nakhon Ratchasima, the province's Secondary Educational Service Area Office worked alongside legal advisors and psychologists to investigate the alleged solicitation of donations at Chumphuangsuksa School.

The officials found that donations were being made, but they were voluntary and aimed at school development, not specifically for a school van, as speculated online.

However, the officials ordered the school to halt the solicitation immediately, clarify the matter with parents and students and ensure that management strictly followed the rules and regulations on such matters.

According to social media allegations that emerged last Thursday, the school distributed five donation envelopes to each student and demanded that parents donate at least 400 baht per envelope. The allegations on social media claimed the donations would be used to buy a school van.

The school's director Viroj Duansantia explained that one envelope was given to each student's family and four for broader community distribution ahead of a fundraising event set for Nov 16 as part of the Buddhist robe-offering season.

The National Anti-Corruption Commission initiated an inquiry into the donation handling at Chumphuangsuksa School and discovered that the donations varied widely in amounts, ranging from 10 to 1,000 baht, which contradicts the online accusations. The NACC, however, requested further documentation to ensure transparency.

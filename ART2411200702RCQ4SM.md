Nestled in the heart of Ploenchit's vibrant district, La Braci has unveiled its highly anticipated culinary offering.

La Braci welcomes guests with an atmosphere of understated elegance, where natural elements blend seamlessly with contemporary design. Warm wood tones, subtle stone accents, and brushed metal touches create a harmonious space. Floor-to-ceiling windows flood the interior with natural light by day, while evening diners enjoy an intimate ambiance accentuated by soft outdoor garden lighting. 

The 50-seat dining area is thoughtfully centred around an open kitchen featuring a custom-made fire pit. Flames dance and wood-fired grills crackle, offering diners an immersive experience where ancient cooking techniques meet modern gastronomy. The restaurant also boasts one of Thailand’s longest counter seating sections.

Chef-Owner Sean Lai and Director of Operations Wachirawit Thananrat (Chef Bank) lead a skilled team of Thai chefs dedicated to delivering a dining experience that transcends the ordinary. Diners can engage with chefs as they introduce their creations from the open kitchen, making each visit an interactive and memorable culinary journey.

**Unique Features of La Braci**

The restaurant's centrepiece is its live fire display, complete with multiple grilling stations tailored to different dishes. This captivating feature offers both visual and aromatic appeal, engaging diners from the moment they step inside.

A step-up garden area at the restaurant's entrance adds a nature-inspired touch, resembling a cosy cave nestled within a vertical mountainside. The design contrasts beautifully with Bangkok’s urban buzz, creating a serene yet dynamic atmosphere.

Chefs present and explain their dishes, detailing ingredients and preparation methods, adding an educational element to the dining experience. This approach makes La Braci’s "fine dining lite" concept both accessible and insightful.

Sean concludes, "At La Braci, we aim to create more than just a restaurant—we want diners to feel connected to the food, the fire, and the community. La Braci is a celebration of fire, flavours, and shared moments, offering an elevated dining experience at an accessible price point."

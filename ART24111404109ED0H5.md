_**“Integrating corporate social impact into business models not only supports the communities where companies operate but also benefits the economy,” Godec remarked.**_

_**“The social impact work by US companies and AMCHAM members benefits Thai people and society, representing one of the most direct and effective forms of people-to-people diplomacy. We hope their positive impact will inspire more companies to embrace corporate social initiatives," he added.**_

The awards programme, which has been a cornerstone of corporate social responsibility in Thailand for nearly two decades, recognises member companies through a tiered system based on consecutive years of achievement: Silver for three years, Gold for five years, and Platinum for 10 years.

This year, 36 companies achieved the remarkable milestone of maintaining their social impact initiatives for more than a decade.
